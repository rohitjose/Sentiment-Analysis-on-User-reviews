leeco-le-1s-eco| 30 May 2016 |1| Below average phone |Last time i was an S4,5,6 user , where all the phones had the same problem.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 30 May 2016 |1| 45 degrees is the new international standard | Dear friends, 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 30 May 2016 |5| *Marvelous* |First thing you should be aware that the normal accepted temperature for a phone is 45 degrees. Well I was not aware of that. So it's a heating issues if the temperature only rises above that!
leeco-le-1s-eco| 29 May 2016 |1| don't buy and regret urself |And even if it does there are multiple steps to be followed before the flipkart team will decide that there is any issue. They will call you at office hours when you have not got the phone as you need to repeatedly factory reset to prove that it's not heating. That is less that 45 degrees.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 28 May 2016 |1| HeadPhones not received |They have no return policy for this phone. So please be aware that you will buy this product if 47 degrees is acceptable as that's the temperature we have recorded but no return still.

leeco-le-1s-eco| 17 May 2016 |1| Flipkart is not genuine |So the total of Rs.4800 which i paid from the pocket!
leeco-le-1s-eco| 17 May 2016 |1| Flipkart has Photoshoped Mobile display image | Hi Buyers, 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 13 May 2016 |4| Good enough after using 1 full day |Flipkart has photoshoped Mobile display image , as border-less display bezeless shown is illustration is wrong. It has normal display bezel around the display and phones heats up too much when is charged may me due to super-fast charging mode. other phone is good at this price point.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 13 May 2016 |4| overall nice phone yet to fully explore it , | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 10 Jun 2016 |2| Lousy Battery |And flipkart should provide with Headphone too bad it proving new one with headphone and cheated with old one. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 08 Jun 2016 |2| Dont expect for long last battery life | I gave it 3 star earlier; updating it to 4. Still to get one year subscription account. Camera clicks blur images if much time is not taken. lag in camera too. Lets talk in good and bad. Battery backup is good in ideal mode, screen consumes much battery life.

leeco-le-1s-eco| 16 May 2016 |1| very disappointed with this mobile |2) Processor and multiplexing processes is like a piece of cake for this mobile, as it has got 1.85 GHz MediaTek Helio X10 Octa Core Processor, which like cheese on cake.

leeco-le-1s-eco| 19 May 2016 |1| Bakwaas product if you are looking to use for 4G |4)The metal body provides an additional confidence on a sudden shock like if the phone falls, the harm will be less
leeco-le-1s-eco| 19 May 2016 |1| If you want to buy iron box take le eco 1s |5) The noise cancellation of the phone is really great and thus provides a crystal clear voice
leeco-le-1s-eco| 17 May 2016 |1| its a iron box |6) Colour Contrast of the phone is very lively and good
leeco-le-1s-eco| 15 May 2016 |5| Very Good Phone | Full Paisa Vasul Phone Thanks Leeco for giving such a nice mobile i like so much and love so much this phone 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 14 Jun 2016 |2| About LeTv Eco 1s | No Doubt phone's features are good. in this range you can't get any other mobile with loads of features. only one thing is poor in this phone that phone heat while charging & talking.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 11 Jun 2016 |2| okay for 10K | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 11 Jun 2016 |2| Poor indoor camera |so if your are full day in AC then its good other wise your pocket will also get warm.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 09 Jun 2016 |1| overheat and no battery backup . | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 08 Jun 2016 |1| le 1st eco gold 32 gb | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 07 Jun 2016 |2| Guys Think Twice Before Buying LeEco | Not a bad deal. Battery Life poor. Features okay. No expandable memory. Camera okay. Selfie Camera Better....4G Not Bad. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 07 Jun 2016 |1| worst mobile | Camera & battery back up is very poor...otherwise okk....go for rn3 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 07 Jun 2016 |1| about terms and conditions | I got yesterday dis mobile ,its get over heat n camera performance is also low its seems 5mp I can easily observeb pixels with out zooming don't buy dis .I going to returning dis mobile .
leeco-le-1s-eco| 06 Jun 2016 |2| It's Cheap Phone |No battery backup too. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 05 Jun 2016 |1| Affects health.High radiation. | Guys I feel bad on buying this phone.i am getting continuous head ache while using the phone.high amount of radiation is radiated and your health can be highly spoiled. other than that phone is awesome in all mentioned specifications. If you are not concerned about the health, go ahead. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 04 Jun 2016 |2| LeEco Le 1s Eco Poor Battery Life | I purchased mobile on 30 May, everything was working fine, but to my surprise, battery was getting drained within 10-12 hours on normal usage. No video streaming or gaming but still the battery was getting exhausted. I had requested for replacement of my phone, which Flipkart has accepted and waiting to try my hands on replaced phone.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |1| Cheap shouldn't mean the quality has to be poor. | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |1| Overheat like an IRON |Software: I think software can be improved. Earlier I used ASUS Zenphone, it had fantastic UI and software. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 30 May 2016 |5| Just go for it. | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 30 May 2016 |1| Not at all good |FM Radio app is missing. I wonder why it is not included in the pre-installed apps. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 30 May 2016 |5| nice phone but not yet received the headphone | This is no doubt a very reasonably priced phone on the market. In the same cost range, it is difficult to get a phone from other well established brands like Samsung, Sony, or such. However, you can get phones in the same range from other Chinese brands.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 30 May 2016 |5| best phone to try |2. Performance: This phone has pretty much above-average performance. I haven't noticed any lags while running any app 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 29 May 2016 |5| Very good at this price. | This phone have overheating issue. Please don't but this at all.Almost 45C temperature has been seen while using this phone and the main concern is with in 5-10 min it is going to overheat.

leeco-le-1s-eco| 26 May 2016 |3| Not Fair | Made a mistake by booking this product early, Hence not getting Headphone worth Rs 1300/- Not fair from FLIPKART....Disappointed....

leeco-le-1s-eco| 21 May 2016 |5| Value For Money | is a perfect phone in that range of price and i am happy and satisfied with its performance Very Good Excellent Product value For Money. 9999/- Its Amazing Price And specification wise very good 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 20 May 2016 |4| Phone looks great but performance well....? |good design , good battery backup,, feel very good in hand ,User friendly,Am very satisfied 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 20 May 2016 |1| Poor camera and display. | Phone has great premium looks but performance not that great. I am giving 4 stars based on its lesser price with features given. Heating issue & poor camera quality are major drawbacks. Also the length of charger wire is bit short. Flipkart is marketing this phone as supertainment phone & not providing headphones with the handset seems to be silly. I can't understand why this phone is being sold through flash sale with MRP price mentioned on its package. Ya right it's not Rs.10999/-. So far things good but phone definitely has issues needs to be resolved through upcoming proposed OTA as being announced otherwise the overwhelming response being shown by customer like me will gradually decline. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 19 May 2016 |1| Faulty item | Very poor camera and flash. The flash is only working in a very dark condition , even then if its work ,its timing is not perfect to get a good image. In light condition also the picture quality is not good. It not looks like 13 mega pixel. My Lumia 620 camera which is only 5 mega pixel has better camera than this phone. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 18 May 2016 |3| Not Good | I received the product just in a day. Its a very good phone initially but suddenly the camera showed malfunctioning with 4-5 lines on the screen.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 17 May 2016 |1| Plz dont buy this phone | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 17 May 2016 |4| Reasonable product |Overall phone is good but may be i had got a faulty piece. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 17 May 2016 |1| Not worth of money | Not supporting the other launchers.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 16 May 2016 |4| Le 1s Eco |Battery back is quit bad.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 16 May 2016 |1| Not a Good Product !!!!!! |Phone is getting heated while speaking in calls. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 16 May 2016 |1| LeEco Le 1s Eco | It generate very heating like a Iron box while using i.e browsing, Charging, Talking & playing game.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 16 May 2016 |1| phone heated like hell | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 15 May 2016 |4| Brilliant Phone! Battery is the only drawback |it's not good.....................

leeco-le-1s-eco| 14 May 2016 |4| decent phone ...at dis cost...le eco 1s eco has done it.. |Don't waste of ur money... 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 14 May 2016 |1| Dont Buy | All in all I would like to give this phone 8/10 for its looks, specs and the Price, the only thing bad about it is the battery, barely lasts about 5 hours on 4G/WiFi with Moderate to Heavy Usage, but then again it does get charged super fast, in about 1 hour 15 mins from 0 -100, so don't forget to carry your Portable Charger with you where ever you go. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 14 May 2016 |5| supertaintment | Have been using a lot ofphones & presently using Lenevo K3 note.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 14 May 2016 |4| Budget phone Premium Looks Good performance |There was so much hype build around this phone that thought of buying it.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 14 May 2016 |5| awesome phone | I was very apprehensive about getting a low budget phone with awesome features that it has to offer. However, I was not disappointed. The phone is worth every penny. The heating issue is a known issue in most of the phones, but the battery hardly drains out. Got the delivery of the phone too faster than expected. Over all a great experience. Hoping that it stays good through the life of the phone. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 14 May 2016 |5| leeco le 1s eco - good product... | More than my expectation .Fast delivery,nice phone,nice look ,good clarity. For me not much heating problem.it will become heat when you play games continuously.thank you letv to launch this phone.

leeco-le-1s-eco| 05 Jun 2016 |3| LeEco Le 1s Eco | I ordered LeEco Le 1s Eco mobile phone on 3rd of June from Flipkart. The phone gets delivered by 4th June, quite a fast delivery by Flipkart. While unpacking the product, we couldn't found the ear phone which comes as an offer while purchasing the phone. All other stuffs were there apart from this particular earphone. After I gone through some of the reviews, i got to know that, I am not the only victim of such false offer This is really a disappointment specially from a renowned online seller like Flipkart. I am taking this issue to the customer care, and lets find out what they say about such issues. And I am requesting Flipkart to put down this offer of giving free earphone, if they are not really able to give to every customer who bought the phone. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 05 Jun 2016 |4| Phone is Very Goods Sans the Camera | Everything in this phone is good, no heating issues. But Camera not upto the mark, my Mi3 had very better camera.

leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| Good Value for Money | Fully loaded feature phone at throw away price. On top of it I could avail good return amount for my old phone and 10% cashback. But I will not shy away from saying that this product can be grabbed at the current price tag as it is worth every penny paid. I have used One Plus 1 and a satisfied customer of it, but this phone has all those features and added to that is IR,quick charger with Type C USB and finger print scan feature. Touch response is awesome and build quality is rich and premium.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| Perfect traveling companion. | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |4| A good product from Le tv |PS: i was earlier consfused between the earlier launched Le Eco which is Rs. 1000 priced higher than this one. But settled for this one having lower speed which was aimed to reduce the heating faced with earlier version, I have not faced any heating issue from last 1 week of use. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| excellent phone | This is one of the best budget phone out there as of now and i don't think some other brand will sell you this top notch features smartphone within 10K.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |4| ðððð |Fast charging feature and fingerprint scanner is simply the best. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| Good Product |13/5 MP rear and front camera gives you a good quality images.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| good option |No heating issue, it heats only when it's on charging. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |1| Phone gets hotness or warm |No lagging issue while playing games, haven't tried all the games i play but still i'm happy with it. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| best phone | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |3| Good Phone at below 10K | 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| LE TEV | Good cellphone within range, i like its feature of fingerprint at back as it is easy to handle, well rest will be come once we start using it in day to day life 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| Excellent Phone | In 9k what all you want, 3GB RAM, 64 GB ROM, thumb sensor with good latest processor in Gold Color. I like the phone and the style. Battery is also having good backup. Normally all mobiles have heating issues so this mobile is also one of them. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |4| Camera quality issu | In this range the product is awsome.but camera qualiti is not 13mp.like 5 mp.Camera flash is not good.otherwise the phone is ok.No heating issu. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| LeEco 1s Eco | Received product on 30th may, the handset is truly value for purchased under flash sale with exchange of old set, very easy exchange and good service provided by Flipkart.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 01 Jun 2016 |5| Awesome Phone for the price |Now about hand set come with premium box packing.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 31 May 2016 |4| Why so many negative reviews?? |Very easy to use and no problem of heating in normal use and surfing. Heats up during game and during downlogins of heavy Apps and Movies.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 31 May 2016 |3| Question mark on delivery of offers |Good touch response but feels some what bulky. No head phone/ earphone were provided by company also charger is extraordinarily big.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 31 May 2016 |5| All the required details about this phone |Their is lots of RAM lots of ROM processor is very good but front and back cameras are not up to mark. Although back cameras results improves after manual setting's but front camera is dembo.
leeco-le-1s-eco| 31 May 2016 |5| a real Superphone |Overall if forgot front camera quality Best handset and value for money with finger print scanner. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 31 May 2016 |3| Could have been better | The phone is working like a charm. I dont know why many people rating this phone very low. I am using the phone from past week and i didnt noticed any heating issue. Max temp reached is 42â while gaming and its is completely normal. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 31 May 2016 |5| Best Deal in this price | The phone is good. One may not find the UI very appealing as compared to MIUI and Touchwiz but its ok. The camera performance is not that great in artificial lighting but then for this price it is good. Memory management is excellent as compared to other ROMS, it keeps most of the recently used apps, games, etc in the RAM and doesn't load them again when we switch between them. So it makes good use of 3 GB RAM unlike MIUI. It's a thumbs up for this product, go for it if your budget is between 9k to 15k. 
leeco-le-1s-eco| 31 May 2016 |5| amazing phone and surprising performance | Excellent phone and worth its price.amazing features and speedy performance
