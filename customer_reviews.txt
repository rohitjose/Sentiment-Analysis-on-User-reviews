leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| Value for money!! | First of all I would like to clarify some misconceptions about the phone.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |5| Surprise! |The piece that I got has no Quality Control issues or any creaking sound on hard press.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |2| Having second thoughts after buying this phone. |Second, both of my SIMs are working fine, no issues with the second SIM card slot.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |5| Best Handset Ever |Third, OTG is working, no heating issues and no signal reception problems. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |4| Best product at the price |The phone is amazing, especially the premium look and great performance. Memory management is appreciable, since it always manages to have at least 850MB RAM free.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |5| It's Stunning !! |The charging speed is too good. I usually charge it when battery level reaches 15% and it takes only 1 - 1¼ hrs. to full charge. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |5| Amazing phone |Previously I thought the Rose Gold color will look girlish, but it is not. That color is actually giving a rich premium look to the phone. The phone didn't get heat up even after playing heavy games like Asphalt. When I am in AC room or in the early morning, the phone will be very cold and it is a pleasure to hold it. It will make you feel cool.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| Awesome |If you are a camera enthusiast, this phone will not be a good choice for you. The camera is average, may be good for this price range, but not appreciable. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |2| In-depth Complete Review. Regret Buying Le 2 |Personally I don't prefer charging and using headphone at the same time since it is not good (risk) for both phone and user. But you will miss two separate ports, if you are a person who plays videos directly from a pen drive using OTG cable. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |5| Unmatched |The free CDLA headset is good, not exceptional or outstanding. Got a flexible transparent back cover also free with the phone.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |5| Awesome..better th redmi note 3 and moto g4 plus | Awesome.e phone...better the redmi note 3..received on 29 the June..camera better than redmi note 3 but not better than moto g4 plus....super smooth....no specific heating issues..played dark knight rises for 1/2 hr....no major heating like in redmi note 3.....bettery backup is good but not as good as redmi note 3.........this phone has best part as it's handset.....so awesome...highest quality...even better than the quality of iPhone headphones....got update within 1 week...both camera good..perfect phone...earlier I was gonna buy moto g4 plus...but after seeing it hanging and heating on normal usage..I decided to go on with Le leeco 2...m pretty much satisfied.....guys go for it.... 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |4| No doubt its better thn xiaomi RN3 | Nice phone, butter smooth performance.. Heat up a bit during heavy use. Screen cracking sound is there but its not the thing which is to be bothered about. 652 soc is quite a gem in this price segment.. Love this device.. Le should ship screen protector too, it would have been so generous of those guys if they did.

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |1| go for redmi note 3 | Total waste of money i think redmi note 3 is much better than this phone viewing angles of the display and brightness ,camera are very much poor if any one buying this please look foe alternative choice this cdla technology is not good either 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 16 Jul 2016 |1| LeEco2!!! Buy r No.. u decide | Defective Product!!
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| LeEco le 2 is the new Sultan! |After doing lot of research I decided to buy LeEco2, feeling great product in budget price. At first, I felt happy to buy Le2 in 3rd flash sale(Immediately after it..free sale). Delivery date 14th shown. But, to my sad, I received on 15th(notified about delay). Eagerly unboxed, n power button pressed. Utter downcast. No start. I thoght, may be no charge. So put on charge for 2 1/2 hrs. Blinking of notification light started. I was happy. But it continued...showing LeEco sign only several times repeated. (I once again tried by pressing power button). No use. Immediately called Flipcart customer care. Male executive answered. When I explained problem, he put on hold for 5 minutes but not responded. Again I called, this time a Lady answered. Really good, Thank u mam. She listned N took return note and for refund. I told her, if it get start I will retain(The whole night I checked, the same symbol going on n off).Today, delivery boy took in return. I give 5***** to flipkart for their response, as I am a regular buyer from them, never any default in their service. Only this time I got the problem. I don't want to go for LeEco. I buy SamsungJ7 which my son using, Very nice one. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 07 Jul 2016 |2| Not good enough | Super awesome phone. Firstly, I would like to thank Flipkart for delivering me this phone well ahead of time and credit goes to WS retailers as well for great packing and delivery. Secondly, it's been a week now I've had hands on this model and I ASSURE you that this phone done what it tells. Have been mingling with this handset ever since I had and it comes to the point that I forgot to take dinner at times. Great specs overall and I dare challenge iPhone 6s users apart from iTunes applications that it has.

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| Full points to this product | Letv has become concerned about its reputation in India and just launched LeEco Le 2 which is really an expert all-round phone (Superfone).
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| BETTER PHONE IN THIS PRICE . | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |3| Le2 Camera is not better than even le1s |Performance:- Has been as fast and smooth as Galaxy S7 as the processor is comparable to it. No lags or misbehaving at all! (10/10)
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |4| Just below great; missed hit. | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |4| Premium value for 11.8k |RAM:- It has been improved a lot from Le 1S and you can get approx 1.5GB Ram free all the time. I open 5-6 apps all the time without any lagging or losing any data. (9/10)
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 10 Jul 2016 |4| Value for money | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 10 Jul 2016 |4| Good |Camera:- It too has been improved a lot more than Le 1S. Both front and back performed well in daylight but did struggle in low light condition but front camera managed. You can take wide-angle selfies too! Overall camera is fair. (8.5/10)
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 10 Jul 2016 |3| Need to optimise Nova 3 | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 10 Jul 2016 |3| battery back not good and sound output is low | battery back not good and sound output is low. since i have purchased this phone and not happy with battery back up 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 09 Jul 2016 |3| Overall the phone is good except the heating issue | Overall the phone is good. Only issue is heating problem - While charging or playing games the battery temperature rises up to 43C+ 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 09 Jul 2016 |3| Bad camera average display | Le eco 2 is having bad back camera front is ok. Display is also average. Good earphone , no heating issues. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 09 Jul 2016 |5| A great challenger rises against redmi note 3 | I had the phone for a dayand here are my thoughts:-
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 09 Jul 2016 |5| Gr8 phone | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 09 Jul 2016 |5| Best Mobile @11999 |For the price, it's a damn good phone. Overheating isn't as much of a problem as it was in Le 1s and the firmware is stable(Check for updates on the phone).Played some games(Persona 3,God Eater) on ppsspp and the phone was just warm.eUI is really not good though, replaced with Play Launcher.Not enough of a cameraphile to judge the picture quality, but it is plenty good for me.Included headphones are great compared to what you would find in other bundled headphone.Fingerprint scanner is actually not a gimmick and you may find it faster than your usually unlocking your phone.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 09 Jul 2016 |5| Amazing |For the negatives i would say that they dropped the ball by giving a single usb type c. I don't mind the new connector but now i cannot charge and listen to songs and movies at the same time.There is no bloatware except two inbuilt apps:- LIVE; which may be helpful by giving a few live tv channel is a handful of language, while Levidi is kind of a flipboard clone and is absolutely horrible. The included Remote Control app is nice, the music player is capable of finding lyrics and the video player is capable of 1080p x265 playback, no need for mxplayer. The file manager is too basic though and the browser is okay. Fast charging is disabled by default and rightly so since enabling it will raise the temps to hell.Battery life is decent. Will last for ab
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 09 Jul 2016 |5| Best from a beast...filling up last year's gaps.! |Also the sad thing is, most probably Letv will not get as much recognition as Xiaomi and thus this phone will be leftout in the modding community and we will most probably wont get a custom rom.However there is an option to unlock the bootloader.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 09 Jul 2016 |5| Performance packed! | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 09 Jul 2016 |3| not bad |All in All if you cannot manage to get your hands on the redmi note 3 try this phone instead. Its a teeny bit faster to boot also, at the expense of some battery life. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 08 Jul 2016 |3| good phone but very poor battery life | good buy at this price but the battery is really poor.....doesn't last for a day. other competitors are offering good battery capacity at this price range or lower. could be a big minus point for leeco. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 07 Jul 2016 |4| Dont wait.Just Go grab it... | A very well priced phone under 12k.Hats off to the company for making a super phone.I liked everything about the phone.But the eui should be taken to the next level.And no doubt leco is taking efforts to do so which has reflected in its 5.8 update of the eui.The camera quality is good.The phone doesn't lag while playing high graphic games.The looks are the ones that make u fall for this super phone.The cdla mode offers a new level of music which is quiet amazing.The Fingerprint sensor is good but lags a bit sometimes that shouldn't be a concern cause it's lagging is 1 in 25 attempts.The audio clarity is pretty good.The phone in my personal opinion should be released in different colours attracting more no of buyer's.My last verdict would go get your hands on this phone and I promise u that u won't be disappointed at all.Giving it 4 stars.Hope to see leco to emerge as a giant in the Indian market on the near future.And I am assured that I won't be disappointed. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 07 Jul 2016 |4| Great phone but.... | Awesome phone, fast and light weight but the display seems to have 2 white patches, I'm a little bit concerned about this particular thing 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 07 Jul 2016 |5| Superb | Superb mobile furnishing excellent 3 gb ram inbult memory 32 gb 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 07 Jul 2016 |4| 4star | I like it .it's value for money product. Go for it with out any hesitation. It's above average, not the very best in market but it's a good competitor below rs15000.phones.. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 07 Jul 2016 |4| good | the handset is as well as good.

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 08 Jul 2016 |2| Don't go for it. | The phone is great. But when I received it I have found out that the second sim slot is not working. At first I thought I was unlucky and ordered a replacement. the replacement came and that too has the same problem. Now I applied for a refund :(

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| LeEco Le 2 (Rose Gold, 32 GB) | Our Le 2 review unit stood out most for its Rose Gold colour, which definitely grabs attention,The front is glass with body-coloured panels above and below the screen, while the sides and rear have a buffed metal finish except for bands of shiny polished metal where the sides meet the front and back is good,Qualcomm's Snapdragon 652 processor also gud 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| LE2 with snapdragon 820 processor? | My LE2 got delivered on friday with same day delivery option. Surprised to see Snapdragon 820 processor in my phone instead of snapdragon 652 in the specs. SD820 is usually found in next level phones priced above 20k, like LE max2 etc.Phone is fast, good looks, no hanging or heating issues (I'm not a gamer). Camera is average, sound is loud and superb. Battery backup is not the best, coming one day with moderate usage. My question is whether the SD820 consumes more battery than SD652? 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Good Phone at this price. | I have been using this phone past 5 days and it has been treating me good. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Amazing Phone at Amazing Price | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Really superphone |Battery backup is not that great. You will have to keep your charger handy. But I think it's with most of the Phones these days.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Happy to purchase Le2 | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Its a Rocking Phone.... |Since it has USB type C charging port, and it is common for charging as well as for earphones, you cannot use your hand free cable while charging. Bluetooth headset is the only option in this case.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Good Phone | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Brliliant |Apart from this, I am trying to find if this phone supports OTG devices.

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Nice Jingk jack Mobile |Camera was a let down- expected more from a 16MP camera. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Happy with your LeEco Le mobile phone | The phone is Good looking. You will never get Snapdragon 652 at this cost; even SD 615, SD 410 costs more if you buy something like sony, samsung etc., Camera is good during day but poor during night. Flipkart's service is good. I got a damaged piece and I noticed it after a week yet they gave me a refund without hesitating. If you need a budget phone with excellent performance this is it. If you have some extra cash go for its big brother le Max 2. It is in Top 3 mobiles as per antutu's 2016 June result. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 25 Jul 2016 |4| Good and recommended | The phone is simply osum in this price range. Features are wonderful and spectacular. The sound and music makes me groove all the time. Heating when charging the phone is the only problem with this device. overall i am having a good experience with it. Buy this phone and enjoy.

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 24 Jul 2016 |4| It will b wrong to ask more of it.... |I've been using this device from a month and I found everything is top notch except camera. I'd high expectations from LeEco regarding that. It doesn't mean, it has a bad camera, the shots captured in day time are stunning but it struggles in low light and artifical lighting conditions. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 24 Jul 2016 |5| best phone. |Apart from that, I didn't find any flaw. Performance wise it's a beast of a smartphone with snapdragon 652 chip under the hood which easily put this device far above it's competition. Talking about other aspects, display is good with great viewing angles and sound quality from headphones is very loud and clear thanks to Dolby Atmos built-in, the speaker output could be loud but it's okay. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 24 Jul 2016 |5| Getting more which you are paying |And the software upfront is EUI 6, which is not as good as Stock or MIUI but it's okay to live with. I hope it gets better and better with time.

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 24 Jul 2016 |5| Amazing Experience |PROS:
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 24 Jul 2016 |4| Value for money | Phone features are completely awesome feels fresh...upto an extent camera is also not bad and after 5.8 eui update gets better battery management and memory app gets additionally after updating only thing you will miss is 3.5 mm jack but the 3.5mm connector fulfill the need. if CDLA headphones would have been provided for everyone it would be the best deal ever.

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 24 Jul 2016 |5| Great Value for money | I just got the package last week. Since then I am using it. Its very smooth and speedy, and the big thing is it works almost a full day with heavy usage. Though it has metal body, its too light to hold such a 5.5" phone without giving paint to your hands. I didn't use camera on regular basis but i would say after the EUI Update it is better then previous version. I would recommend this product to my friends and family. Definitely.

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 23 Jul 2016 |5| Best mobile | I am very confused in LeEco le 2 n Mi note 3 while buying a new phn for me... I made my decision for le 2.. When i got d phn it was superbly packd. I used d phn and found it very strong. The sleek metal body , fast fingerprint sensor, quick charge, remote control, auto call record option were very intersting. Qualcomm snapdragon 652 processor very gud at this price tag ! User interface and camera could be more better... Bt anyways at this price tag, really getting a good package..

He has reviewed hundreds of products ranging from smartphones and tablets to PC components and accessories, and has also written guides, feature articles, news and analyses. Going beyond simple ratings and specifications, he digs deep into how emerging products and services affect actual users, and what marks they leave on our cultural landscape. He's happiest when something new comes along and challenges everyone's assumptions about how things should work, what they should look and feel like, and who can benefit from them.

I am giving 4 star because the camera is not that much good but its ok and I don't know why the people are telling that there is a sound on pressing the screen is I have not face any issue like that and truly the phone is truly a value for money you can not get anything much better in this price segment of 12 k but I want to know about the earphones that were to be given with this phone but they have not come yet so I hope they will deliver it soon

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 22 Jul 2016 |5| Best Mobile in its Price Range.. | The Le 2 is a good alternative to the Redmi Note 3 and comes with a lot of free media content. There were reviews about the display making a noise when pressed hard. However in normal usage I have not faced any issue. The screen appears a little flexible, possibly because of the inside being hollow. Overall it is good value for money.

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 22 Jul 2016 |5| About Performance and camera | I have got this phone 2 days back and I would clarify that it is a great phone with rich look and nice tough body. There is no such heating problem as people have mentioned. Charging is really turbo charging. Only Con is that I did not get CDLA earplugs with this phone and it has a type C USB port, so you can not use OTG pendrive with this phone. Also you ll have to charge it with a type C port charger only.

Only sadness is I didn't got earphones in the box which I expected that time.... It really looks very rich to hold this phone in hand....and for those who are in a dilemma of which phone to buy, go for le it really pays you back<3

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |5| Awesome phone but highest permitted SAR value | Its a beautiful phone! Display is awesome,battery lasts a day easily. Cameras are great,I got really high resolution pics on rear 16 MP,and it takes very quick photos,so no complaints on both rear ar front camera. 1.2-1.6 GB ram is free even if I am running multiple apps. No lags! Fingerprint was very fast in the beginning,but after a month of use,it sometimes takes up a second to open. The unified jack isn't a problem to me. CDLA earphones are good,but take up much more battery than normal earphones.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |5| Good phone for its price |Cons :
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |4| Awesome!! |Inbuilt speaker isn't that good,youtube videos sometimes sound funny on DOLBY atmos. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |5| A must buy mobile |The main con is the SAR value. Its 1.6 kW/g on both head and body,the MAXIMUM level permitted. My head and hands begin to pain after 1 hr of continuous use. I tried to contact LeTV authorities about the SAR a number of times,nobody replied.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |3| phone looking good but software issues there |Since it has a metal body,it heats up a bit,especially during charging.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |4| Awesome |Overall,a great phone. Great satisfaction in showing off to friends with Redmi Note 3 ;) 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |5| Must have 1 | Good phone for its price range, used it for 1 day did not find any smallest issue also....
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |5| Value for Money .... Good Features |Camera clarity is awesome..
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |4| Worth every penny.. | I had to rate it 4 stars ..just because of the battery...it doesn't last long...what I mean by long is ..on general use..it just barely gives you 6hrs backup if use it sparesly...few hrs of wifi,gaming,browsing,is all that it can handle in that time not continuously but intermittently..rest you can throw what ever you like...it'l handle like a professional...

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |5| Le2 - Midrange Killer |3 features are good 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |4| my le Eco 2 | It cannot play all high performance games like moto g did.. for gaming I will give 6 out of 10. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |4| MISSING IN BOX | Hai friends.. its looks nice and delivery also fast. Type C charger works very well; within 1hr 45min will take for full charge. No heating,except if you continuously play games for more than half an hour. But only thing is you should buy CDLA ear phones for enjoying the music, even though they are providing adapter for 3.5mm jack,, its doesn't feel good. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |2| Average phone with lots of malfunction.. | I chose this phone was bought for my wife not only because she loved the colour & design from the pictures but also the specs of Le2 was quite ahead of the competition. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |4| Excellent phone | 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |4| Mobile features |She was delighted to see the new phone & thankfully it's all metal design and brushed finish really appealed to us. It feels much like a premium phone. The bezel less design is quite simply breath-taking. We also loved the fact that the phone did come with a silicone transparent skin cover. Even the sim-trya key oozes quality. So from a fit-finish design & construction aspect this gets 11 on 10. :)
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |3| Good | Correct Rate...But Some Issue In software the multiple contacts cannot delete at the same time and picture quality is good but when you zoom it it looks Bad....and some setting like backward and taskbar option are difficult ...mostly it s a mini smart Tv that cost 11K....that's It... 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |3| poor display protection | every thing is good compared to price.yesterday it slipped from table,just two feet,disply broken to pieces.no protection for disply,be carefull before buying.already have MI phones, many times they slipped and fell,no problem.two years now no problems. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |2| bad services | really fed up with services of flip cart , i had ordered 4 product in this 2 weeks and all have issue like received damaged or different color and size. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |3| Good phone with some unavoidable drawbacks | 1. C type charging port is unique and is therefore not universal and you can not use your friends charger for charging your phone.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |3| OK but not great |2. I don't see any improvement in audio quality over 3.5mm Jack port.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |4| Not the best camera |3. I have received set with snapdragon 820 4 core processor instead of 652 Ocracore as being claimed, can't say whether it is better or not.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |3| Review |4. Fingerprint Response time is good.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |5| Super phone but battery should have been better |5. Screen resolution is good but with no corning gorilla glass.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |5| Nice phone |6. Yet at this price point , it is worth to buy. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |4| Amazing | The product is just OK, my screen got scratched in pocket without any key or coin, cg3 is just for name shake. Sound output with type c to 3.5 mm converter is worst. Camera output is just average.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |5| IT's not a phone, Its life | Phone. This is not a phone. Its whole world into it. The experience i have got using it is tremendous. I love it.!!! I hope the models would come more in the future. 
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |4| le2 | le 2is best phone ever it has some heating issues and battery draining problem but the phone do not hang it work smothly.under this prise level this is the best smart phone comparing with redmi note 3

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |5| Fantastic Phone | No doubt phone is super...but I am facing 2 prob there is no option to off the vibration on writing pad ..and it is not connecting with pc

leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |5| Le Eco 2 |Software is not customisable like mi Ui. But software upgrades can be made. Hardware can nt b upgraded.. So hardware matters more.. I have not faced any heating issue.. temperature rises not more than 42 degree on extensive gaming..
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |5| Awesome Experience |Dont go for this one if camera is ur priority. My priority was gaming and this stands out.. Just I m not sure about the after sales service.. I they can provide good after sales, they can beat any brand in this price range.. They have provided gorilla glass also.. And the design is premius.. Looks good in hand..
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |4| Awesome |UI is god too. Not too many apps preloaded.
leeco-le-2-rose-gold-32-gb| 19 Jul 2016 |5| Grab the phone as soon as possible. |Lots have people have faced dual sim card problem which i dont have faced. So quality control should be maintained by LEECO.. Evry other person hv faced a new problem.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 13 May 2016 |4| Overall good |3. 13 MP f/1.9 Camera quality is just awesome. The front camera as well is capable of taking good selfies. The flash provided for front camera is not that much necessary but yes if you are selfie addicted person then you the importance of it :)

I charged my phone to 100 % and it took about 2 and half days to discharge with 6-8 hours of talk time, 4-5 hrs of music listening and connected to WiFi/MobiData Network continuously. Isn't it GREAT ? and it took 2 hours to charge the phone from 0 to 100%. I am very surprised with the battery performance. Nice job Samsung.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 12 Jun 2016 |1| Samsung Galaxy J7 - 6 (New 2016 Edition) | Dear People Please dont buy this phone on flipkart. this s a useless firm with no dedication of work. they are such big liars cant tell u. this phone doesnt work as it has speaker problem. They told me they will return bt their policies are so difficult thtat it will take whole month but you end up with dead mobile. these ppl are big big liars. the smart app which they gave me doesnt download even. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 20 May 2016 |2| Good Phone but not happy with Flipkart |PLEASE PPL DONT TAKE THIS PHONE FROM HERE U PPL WILL SUFFER A LOT> THEY DONT REFUND THE MONEY 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 19 May 2016 |1| THE WORST AND WORST SERVICE by flipkart | Phone is good but I believe it's overpriced for the hardware what you get. Screen could have been FHD at the minimum and speaker volume is not great, have challenges to hear ring tone while on the road or outdoors. Battery backup is great. Lack of sensors is a big con and Samsung is just taking us for granted.
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 11 May 2016 |5| Really a beast in mid range phones | 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 17 May 2016 |3| Decent |Now the reason for 2 stars, my phone has a problem with signal reception and I always see either 1bar or no signal with sim 2 slot (It's not an issue with sim, tested with sim 1 slot and other phones) . I have raised a replacement request on day one when I observed the issue. Flipkart executive asked to me to install the diagnostic app and got the logs and said that I'll get a call from executive to who will physically inspect the device and make a call on replacement in 72 hours. Now it's more than 72 hrs., nothing has happened. I'm sure they will reject replacement request in a day quoting obvious reasons. This was the case with my Moto phone last year.
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 21 Jul 2016 |5| J7'6-Again Samsung Wins! |I believe integrity and trust are the foremost for any ecommerce vendor in market place and Flipkart is moving away from it. So guys please think twice before you pay significant money to a online vendor, also check and double check the replacement and returns policy. For now at least I'm not happy with the Faking Flipkart Customer service :( :(

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 21 May 2016 |3| Ok type phone | Nice phone but still overpriced it should be below 10000.00 inr 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 19 May 2016 |5| Great Budget Phone from Big Brand | I bought this phone (Gold colour) on 10.05.2016 midnight when the sale opened. Received in 2 days. As a budget phone from Samsung it is definitely a worthy buy. It has a bright HD display though FHD should have been the case, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM. Exynos 7870 is a powerful octacore processor built on latest 14nm technology which makes it highly power efficient as well as performance driven. This is a major secret of long lasting battery (coupled with 720p screen). OS is bloat free which a welcome change after many years. I am liking the new TouchWiz (same style as latest S7 edge). No heating problem and you can easily play hardcore graphic intensive games easily. Metal frame is very good but battery cover is flimsy. Samsung in 2016 should have put atleast Gorilla Glass 3 on the display (you need to invest on good quality Tempered glass screen). Though there is no secondary noise cancellation mic (!!!) but call quality is good. Speaker sounds very low, major disappointment though sound quality is very good if you use a good quality headphone. Recommended BUY. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 19 May 2016 |5| Incredible phone and service of flipkart | Cheers to flipkart for there incredible service delivered in 20 hours and the phone is superb as expected i was confused between redmi note 3 & lenovo k4 note but thanks to that creapy flash sale that turn my mood to this trusted brand.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 23 Jul 2016 |5| J7-6, not a Fanboy review. | J7-6 is a beautiful cell phone could make a illusion of I phone 6s from far as per design considered. But its not exactly same like I phone, there is Samsung proprietary home bottom and camera, flash light design. Old J7 clicks more batter picture than new though the camera hardware is same. Camera application in marshmallow need more optimization. Nothing valuable upgrade as per me except the metal frame design with more slim profile. Phone looks far batter and premium than J7 2015. Rest of all upgrade not useful for a mediocre user. No practical use as of now for NFC in India as no NFC payment available as of date. Most people do not use a NFC enabled speaker system too. Also I have noticed Marshmallow lags a lot in this phone than Lollypop in 2015 model though this phone has a newer version CPU and more RAM, don't know why. But those people who used the old model like me can feel the difference very often. There is lack of sensors like Gyro so you could not use VR and google cardboard not supported. Might be software not optimize properly and Samsung lunched it too quickly before get go ahead from development team :) I am not happy with the performance but like a lot the new design. Battery was always better in J7 one of the reason why I always used to choose Samsung. Screen is same as previous model no change. Hope Samsung will release new update soon to fix the bugs in new OS. J7 is best buy no doubt for the price of 15k to 16k. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 23 Jul 2016 |5| Best phone after one month of use and review. | Thank you every one to write reviews referring to this I got the phone..... it just superb.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |5| Nice product | I am pretty much whimsical when it comes to samsung every time because of the obvious reasons. But this one i tell you flushes away those ill experiences down the gutter and with that range and the features + the built quality; i say it's a good buy. Well no stuff ever produced is perfect and those complaining about lack of features in this , i guess, expect samsung to close down as more inputs would cease the sale of other flagship models. ?

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |3| Beast of a phone with Sound of an Ant. | Samsung Galaxy J7 New Model 2016 is a Beast when it concerns Raw Power. The Battery Back up is Simply amazing, the pack had enough Juice to last me about 2 days on moderate usage. The performance of the set is Lethal. This phone Never Lagged or Hung and does not Heat only gets a little warm after playing for 30 minutes of Graphic Intensive Games like Asphalt 8 and Nova 3. SMSUNG's J7 2016 SMASHES All competition hands down. The Only let down is its Speaker Volume which is very Low while watching Video's on You Tube or for that matter listening to a track. The Ringtone is Barely Audible. The other CON of J7 is its Camera module whose performance at this price point of 16000 is simply unacceptable, when Its Chinese Counterparts like Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo come up with much better camera modules and at a much lower Price. Low Light Photography is Impossible, the camera module produces a lot of noise and even daylight images are not very Sharp. The 2015 J7 had a much better Camera and Screen RESOLUTION. The Screen Resolution inspite of it being a Super Amoled Screen does Live up to the mark set by its predecessor's, other than that J7 2016's performance is Superlative if not Exemplary.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |3| Not worthy | I took this phone. Camera quality is not at all up to the mark. It's not worth of 16000/-. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |5| Best Mobile | Best mobile I have ever used. Camera quality good, charging is so fast, OTG cable supported, slim set. Ear Phone may be better. Only Indian sim cards can be used.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 06 Jun 2016 |4| My opinion | Overall nice phone.but no notification, no auto brightness, Battery is good 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 06 Jun 2016 |5| Nice phone :) | I wanted a new phone and had several options starting from Lenovo zuk z1,xiaomi redmi note 3,Yunicorn,upcoming Zenfone 3 and the Samsung as well.I am a not a fan of samsung phones because of their silly design and laggy touchwiz UI,still after reading reviews and spending lot of time on youtube i grew very fond of this device.Coming to the specs it doesnt have an auto brightness sensor or full metal body or gorilla glass or fingerprint sensor like its competitors.Still the device is solidly built and the gold version looks great.Super amoled display and the exynos with no heating and low power consumption even during prolonged use makes its a great device.And the battery is very good as well for a 3300 Mah and charging times are also good.Go for a good tempered glass and a case to enhance the device.In comparing with xiaomi the super amoled and camera are very nice.The performance will be higher in xiaomi but heating and reliability issues will be there will in xiaomi if you are thinking of buying one. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 06 Jun 2016 |5| Best & Smart Phone | I was waiting for this phone for long time. As I expected it is the best phone with large screen and very slim. Has Dual sim and 16GB storage capacity.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 05 Jun 2016 |3| Only India SIM Allowed | I ordered the phone for using as my second phone which I plan to use during my travel outside India (which I need to do frequently). The flipkart portal does not display the fact that only Indian SIM will work. When I received the phone, I saw the sticker on the pack mentioning that only Indian SIM can be used. I called SAMSUNG and learnt that foreign SIM can be used but one has to use Indian SIM upon landing overseas and has to make a call (using Indian SIM - means roaming charges) for 5-6 mins. Upon learning this I decided to return the phone (The pack seal is unbroken), but flipkart won't take it back!!!! I am disappointed with flipkart!!!!!

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 05 Jun 2016 |5| J7 2k16 is one of the best budget smartphones. | J7 2016 is a beast of a smartphone. I am totally satisfied with this phone. In the era of heating boxes for smartphones, this phone doesn't heat up at all. It flashes through anything you give to it. All apps work smoothly. Speaker's volume is satisfactory. I didn't find it extremely low as many had said. Battery life is the USP of this phone. Whopping screen on time of 12 hours! Just buy this one! Bang for your bucks.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 30 May 2016 |4| Data storage insufficient | i am very happy to have such a beautiful smartphone with me . * at first i was very confused which phone to opt as there ware many choices as the price was a littel high for j7 , i was thinking to buy mi note 3 which was under 12000 range . * but i thought a lot for many days and finally i decided to buy samsung galaxy j 7 and thank god it was my best choice . first of all is the display which comes in 5.5 ich with a super amoled display . * watching videos , playing games , brousing ,facebook are the best the best part is the camara with front flash with high quality image so people looking for a premium device with a decent performance , with the best display must go for this , a littel dissapointing , and the sad point is the some features missing , like geyroscope sensor ,magenetic sensor , finger print scanner , 720 resolution , insted of 2 gb ram , 3 gb ram would have been better * but i had become fan of the super amoled display * great mobile with only some features missing that dont mind for me . buy the phone you will feel proud and each time when you look at your phone you will be very happy because of its best design , i chooce the golden frame which looks premium *Now taking about the gaming it works lag free the colour reproduction , graphics , frames are all best , it is good that the phone supports 10 multi-finger touch , which helps you while playing shooting games , * Touch response also very good , smooth like butter feel very happy to right more and more by using the great mobile of samsung * I want to say that at first i was not happy about low budget phones by samsung which had the hanging problems , but now because the samsung has developed a lot it had given the best mobile under the medium budget * i would saythat samsung has gone far a lot and lot in 2016 *

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 23 May 2016 |5| simply superb phone |Amazing looks. pictures are decent. camera is slight complicated. but pictures are great. People ask me why i purchased Samsung phone when i can have other phones at a cheaper price and with more better specs this days. But I invested few more bucks in this phone for satisfaction and secure feeling the brand gives me plus it has got all the specs a basic user needs. i use my phone full time and as a student. i m perfectly happy with this phone. 1 star less because of the RAM it could have been 3 or 2.5 least.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 23 May 2016 |5| 1.6ghz 14nm exynos and speed (go for it) | Using this mobile for 12 days and its working fine . This is a beast in this price . You may get a fhd metalic look 3gb ram and fingerprint in this 16k but you cant get SAMSUNG and you have to through your mobile(iron brick) in 2 years . Processor is 14nm which is the main thing and phone will never heated even in playing blackout 5, asphalt 8 nova games .Battery is huge (3000 amp removable )and will last about 20 hrs (randomly playing games music and watching films ) Display is very good and you cant feel you are not using fhd . RAM is enough . Front Camera is not too good but ok but rear camera is awesome .14 nm exynos 1.6ghz processor is main beauty of this mobile . 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 23 May 2016 |5| Samsung galaxy j7 2016 |So if you want to buy a real smart phone in about 16k this is the best so blindly go for it . Though you can get samsung galaxy s5 in about 17k which is also great phone but 2 yrs old now :)

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 16 May 2016 |5| Excellent mobile in this price segement from Samsung | Waiting for this for a long time. Now it is in my hands and as expected the phone is awesome. No lags super fast performance and it takes only 2.5hr to complete charge the battery from 5 to 100%. But the back camera is not up to the mark. It's auto focus is not that good. Except this the phone is outstanding. So camera lovers stay away from this.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 16 May 2016 |4| Review from an user. |Only not happy with flipkart as they had not provided the 4G sim as promised. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 15 May 2016 |5| Again a blockbuster device by sammy | Pros:
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 15 May 2016 |5| Monster with Diamond finish look |Runs 2 days with great battery backup(wifi, Mobile data always on)
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 15 May 2016 |4| Good | Got my phone on the 14th. Flipkart sent me an out for delivery message on the 13th but failed to deliver. Even on the 14th evening I had to firmly tell the delivery boy not to miss delivery on 14th as he was citing too much workload. Flipkart top honchos seem to be blissfully unaware of the fact that their logistics guys are not able to cope up with the delivery schedules due to far too many packages to handle. In short Flipkart delivery is sucking big time at least here in Dehradun.
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 15 May 2016 |5| Samsung with a nice but not awesome device |Coming to the phone now. The J7-6 is good looking phone with metal casing but the battery cover is flimsy and pretty cheap. The plastic is fragile and it is difficult to understand as to why Samsung couldn't at least provide better quality plastic. The performance of the phone is fantastic. There is no lag whatsoever and even with multiple apps running the 2GB RAM spares around 300 odd MB. The 5.5 inch amoled hd screen is beautiful with great depth in colours and excellent viewing angles. Both front and main cameras have prima facie given good results. The battery is sufficient to last for a day with normal usage. Since I am not a tech freak therefore I couldn't decipher the difference in Android Marshmallow and previous Android Lollipop; hope someone will educate on this. Finally I would give it 4stars and I deducted 1star because of the flimsy battery cover. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 14 May 2016 |5| best of best | It is really a nice phone. You can trust it. But don't compare it with any Chinese product like Lenovo Xiaomi or Asus. It feature is less some time it looks like over price but it's quality of given feature is nice. With this phone you can't say awesome but after some time when you avail Samsung customer support and service you feel really good.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 02 Jul 2016 |1| very very bad | Ordered the phone at around 12 midnight of Friday (01.7.2016) without opting for one day delivery and got it at around 3 pm in the afternoon on Saturday (02.7.2016). Super quick delivery from flipkart. Everything is good except for sound and display. Sound is definitely on the lower side causing difficulty in hearing the ringing sound in a crowded place. And the display also seems washed out and too bright. While playing the card game solitair, the card colours appear unnatural and are a strain on the eyes. I have selected adaptive display. If I select basic display mode, the display becomes very dull. I wasn't expecting such a display from Samsung. So far, I have mainly used Samsung phones and this is the worst display. And this is super AMOLED?

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 04 Apr 2016 |2| Good but heating issue and battery | Display is good, viewing angles are fine, minor lags occurs but they are negligible, Camera is not upto the mark , low light and indoor photos seem to be too noisy. battery gets charged in less than 2 hrs and 1.5 A output charger does it job fine but not that great. Battery life is something which should be improved. Continuous usage of 5 hours reduced the battery from 100 to 25% Design and look are fine. Hope lenovo releases an update for improving performance of battery and camera .Audio is simply superb, dolby does it job well. Overall Its a decent phone for its price, it performs good for normal usage and not recommended for heavy users.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 08 Apr 2016 |1| over heating issue |Only one big issue is heating after playing game or browsing for 20 minutes.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 08 Apr 2016 |1| DONT WESTE YOUR MONEY |Dont tell me for ota upgrade because i already two upgrade which one for 93 MB and second 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 06 Apr 2016 |4| about phone |58 MB. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 02 Apr 2016 |3| Good but not that good! | I have purchased this phone month before, but I am facing serious heating problem and battery backup issue.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |4| LENEVO VIBE K5 PLUS | Received within 3 days of order placed. In time delivery of product is appreciated but about Lenevo Vibe K5 Plus, the Camera is not very good as expected and heating problem is there. Touch is good & sound is very good. Weight is also very light. Good phone in this range but heating issue need to be resolved by the manufacturer. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 14 Apr 2016 |5| A good device for a reasonable price | I took a huge risk even with so many negative issues and purchased this phone. You know what? I am glad I listened to my inner feelings rather than the reviews! 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 01 Apr 2016 |2| good ...it order when price fall down lillle bit more |First thing I will address - the phone does heat up, but it does as much as is expected from a metal clad phone. Nothing abnormal. The phone prompted for a 93 MB update soon after I connected it with my home Wi-Fi network and I installed it. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to use this phone as a "heating pan" or for "omelette" as some have claimed they did.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 29 Mar 2016 |1| devastated |Secondly, the battery life is reasonable and it should easily last a day under moderate usage. There are NO battery drain issues. Call quality is great and there have been no call drops for me so far.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 29 Mar 2016 |1| HEATING LIKE HELL !!!! |Third, for photography - it captures very good pics with good amount of detail under good lighting conditions but there is some noise in low light. This is a very typical smartphone camera performance in the low to mid-range.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 27 Mar 2016 |2| not worth, its like iron box, |Fourth point, the listing for Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus CLEARLY MENTIONS the "IN THE BOX CONTENTS" as I quote, "Handset, 2-pin Wall Charger, USB Cable, Battery", unquote. It's incredible that so many folks were disappointed that "they did not find headphones in the box."
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |1| phone or heater..wrost phone |I personally believe that for low to mid-range smartphones, you must have your expectations right. For example, this device runs heavy games like Mortal Kombat, Fifa and Asphalt 8 just fine, but only at low to medium settings.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |1| Waste Mobile Money Waste Time waste |Now, being a mid-range device there are bound to be shortcomings. For example, Lenovo could have included some carry case or cover for phone in the box - the device is, plainly put - slippery. I am waiting for the cover I have ordered. The phone looks rather bland from the front and capacitive buttons on the front are not backlit.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |2| Flipkart has given false configuration |Though the inclusion of Dolby Atmos is great, the positioning of speakers on the back is disappointing. I believe the front had a lot of bezels above and below the display and the speakers should have been accommodated there, just like in Vibe K4 Note or Vibe X3.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Mar 2016 |1| Donot buy | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |2| Good but not best | Overall product is ok but not the best. this time Lenovo really make fool to Indian people by saying that they use Snapdragon 616 processor 1.7 Ghz octa core The processor was a Qualcomm Snapdragon but was disappointed to find 1.5 GHz Processor instead of 1.7GHz as mentioned here, also you get 1.8Gb of RAM instead of 2Gb.asks you to choose your default 4G/3G SIM after which the other SIM automatically gets assigned to 2G network which is very annoying 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 04 Apr 2016 |2| Over Heating issue not solved even after software upgrade | The phone is really good from all aspects except the major heating problem, which still remains even after the latest software update of 119mb. Phone gets heated within 3-4mins of normal usage and burns the ear if you receive or make calls. Rest the product is really nice. But this overheating problem being really intolerable, I am going to return the product. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Mar 2016 |3| best budget phone with little heating effect | This phone is good at this price range. Camera (both front and back), sound, display, look, touch response and everything is very good except it has some heating effect. This is the review after using one whole day. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |3| Dolby disappointment | I bought Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus only for Dolby but very much disappointed (too much Treble and low Bass -- not good enough).
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 16 Jun 2016 |2| Heats like Fry pan. U can cook egg on its back | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 24 Mar 2016 |3| Bad Camera Quality. |I own a Lenovo Vibe K4 Note as well which has truly amazing Dolby effect. I am using Samsung E0-EG920BBEGIN In-Ear headphones (Rs929) with both K4 note and K5 Plus.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Mar 2016 |4| Good phone.. | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 06 Apr 2016 |2| Heating Problem |If you are a music lover and buying for Dolby experience, I'd recommend you to avoid this phone and go for K4 Note. In all other respects, Vibe K5 plus is great buy.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |1| Not a good one.... | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |1| over all dispointed |Pros

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 31 May 2016 |5| Go for it |After 100% charging the batter says 4 hours left( That means 4 hours for 100% charging?)
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 15 Apr 2016 |1| waste of time and money |The speed where it charges is equal to time which discharges.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 30 Mar 2016 |5| i just love this mobile |Very disappointment.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 30 Mar 2016 |5| My honest review, I am fully satisfied | I generally do not give rating 5 to any one unless it is really good

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |5| Good buy |Excellent phone in this range, display is awesome, Battery is good, performance is good, overall phone is good, I was waiting from a long time to buy a phone like this, I do not want to buy a phone which is 5.5 inches, this is handy easy to carry and manage do this too much just grab it.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 24 Mar 2016 |1| Do not Buy! |The Camera is decent but there are better camera around for this price range. My suggestion is to use other Camera apps than the stock one.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 23 Jul 2016 |5| Awesome Phone |As soon as I hooked up to the WiFi..there were two system updates provided. My guess it is bug fixes as I dont see version upgrade.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 18 Jul 2016 |3| Over Heating |I played games for 30 mins and it is hot as hell(so you can see the quality of hardware).
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 15 Jul 2016 |4| Review almost after14 days |On heavy games or applications, the battery drains like water in hot summer sun.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 02 May 2016 |4| Good to buy | The phone heats up even when idle. Uncomfortable to hold. Poor battery, doesn't last a day. Worst camera in this price range. Flipkart denied return, denied the phone overheats. Lenovo says that overheating should be considered normal, whereas it is a serious health hazard. I emailed Flipkart Resolution, but received no response. All I am left with is 8k worth of overheating brick that I will not be using (or gifting). Will never buy from Flipkart and Lenovo ever again.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 04 Apr 2016 |1| review |Camera: Good Quality camera. I have seen some reviews saying lack of camera quality, but the camera quality is really good. There is a cover at the back of the camera, you have to first remove that, failing in that might be a reason for bad reviews about camera quality.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 31 Mar 2016 |1| Very poor display and clarity |It has a 1.5A rated charger, mainly used for phablets. It feels little heated while charging, I'll rephrase, it does not feel like iron. My other phone nexus 4 gets more heat than this. Phone getting 'little' heat 'sometimes' is pretty normal these days, it's not Nokia world anymore. People who've owned Android previously can correlate this. Besides it's an octa core processor.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 30 Mar 2016 |1| heating issue | Too much heating

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |4| Worth the Money | So far so good. Have been using this phone for over a week. Nothing so great to mention about except its brilliant dispaly and excellent sound. Battery life is also good. What we get at this price is quite satisfactory. So far I have not faced any problem. Some users mentioned about over heating but i dont observe any over heating in my phone. No extra or special feature to mention about. Camera quality is good. Not very great pics in dark. Front cam is better than expected. Vibe UI is not so apealing. Needs to be refined. Overall looks and feel of the phone is good. Easy to hold and lightweight. The back cover which company claims to be of aluminum actually looks like plastic. Processor is also 1.5 Ghz not 1.7 Ghz. Out of 16GB inbuild memory about 12 GB is available for user. And its not 4G/4G. Only one sim 4G. Overall a good phone for normal users. This phone is not for gamers.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |4| no return policy from flipkart | during purchase you will see that 10 day replacement is available. But actually flipkart not did so. My phone is having battery backup and heating issue but phone not replaced. Gaming is smooth but mobile heat badly and baterry drain rapidly those i did OTG update. So unable to play game like nova3 for long period. If you not play games, still batery backup is poor you have to chagre mobile twice in 12 hours. Else screen is very nice but not 5 inch disply. Display is 4.5inch and total phone is 5.5 inch. If we left battery and heating issue then phoe is best. Connect your phone with remote and play game with vr glass. Experience is very superb 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |2| Bought with really good expection..But no use!!! | Its very sluggish handset in terms of UI. Rear Camera Qualiy is very Poor . Device slightly lags!!! If u want to buy Cell phone under 8K . Then this would be the good option to buy for normal usage 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |5| Lenova K5 Plus | Wow , I have Ordered and received a Lenova K5 Plus. It was amazing performance and good product delivered by flipkart . In this mobile was reasonable price for this high performance. Once again thanks Flipkart. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |3| K5 Plus | The product is very good. But the unfortunate thing is that FLIPKART has sent me a piece which is damaged. I wonder how do they miss to check out if the piece is good or not. How could they just send it and then now when i give a complain about it they say they need 3 days to work on it. When they could send the product in a day why cant the resolution be provided in a day? 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |3| Everything else Camera is good. | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |5| Reliable |Products are good with flipkart but the delay in service is disappointing even after explaining the emergency of the requirement. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Nice phone | This is nice after update no heating issues touch little bit low camera too. other than this is best phone ... 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Amazing phone.... | After all camera is excellent...i loved the phone ...design is amazing...full on i phone look..im really happy and will suggest to take it ...just having little but problem of heating

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |3| Lenovo K5 Plus Review | The phone is good but the heating issue is something that cannot be overlooked. Also the radiation level of the phone is quite high (Lower than other COSTLY phones) which is severely impacting pregnant women. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Great Purchase | No complain about the delivery of the product. The Phone itself is a good one. No heating problem. But its camera is a poor one, specially the Flash. If a snap is taken with flash it becomes too hazy. Without flash in low light the picture is not prominent. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Nice phone under 8.5K | The mobile is pretty, practical and easy to use. I have so many reviews about people saying it has heating issues, but did not find any. Its performance is fast and response is good. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Future Regular Buyer to FlipKart | As many people have already given their reviews, I will try not to repeat and as short and precise as possible. These are my observations and may differ for any other person. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus |Look and feel: 4.5/5
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |5| Excellent phone |Great aluminium casing, great touch sense. Touch sense has some problem at upper edge when sliding down for settings. Better to use tempered glass instead of screen guard that comes with the phone. Feeling of an iphone for Golden color handset. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| value for money | So far so good..delivery of the product was well before schedule date. Have been using this phone for past 8 days. It seem to be working fine, speed is good, touch is good, overall performance good. Value for money. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Good phone at a budget price. | I didnt find the over heating issue after installing the updates as was stated in the reviews by many buyers. I am already using a one plus phone and the heat is almost the same for both. But i had network connectivity issues. I got that phone replaced and the new one was working absolutely perfect. A great phone at a great budget. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |5| AWESOME MOBILE | awesome phn ever i used... it has great processor with great high sound with dolby sound option..... just camera is normal... but expect camera.... every feature in mobile is great in lowest price 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| Amazing delivery | I just ordered yesterday in flipkart advantage. In day delivery. I ordered around 12pm, today I received 11am within 24hrs. That's great. After getting my product I excited. I opened the pack whether phone or stone. Conformed its fully sealed original lenovo phone. Neatly packed. Amazing phone loved it. Best budget phone worth to buy. Thanks to flipkart. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |3| Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus | If you are not much interested in Gaming and photography this phone is good for you.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| All is well |I have observed some issue with that phone:
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| A Good product in the price range |1. In gaming it has heating issue.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| one of the best handset |2. Camera Quality is not so good, it is above the average but not good.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| EA - Exceeded all Expectations, Rating 1. | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| Fantastic phone at an unrealistic price |But Front Camera is better than other phones, If you are crazy about selfies then it is good for you.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| Just what I want. | First off, the incredible heating issue. As soon as the phone was switched on, it started and the device got as hot as an iron. However, as soon as update was completed, switched off and fully charged, issue was resolved. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| In love with this phone |Phone looks very good, is very slim and bright. Fast and responsive, battery seems OK so far, and 10 GB usable internal memory is just fine for me. I like things simple so UI is quite OK for me. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |3| dont purchase |Camera is so so and not so sharp but if I want to take pictures I'd buy an SLR camera instead, so it's livable with. I've not played games with it but I prefer to play games on a PC rather than a phone so that's OK for me.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |2| Do not waste money for this phone |All in all I'm satisfied. Just what I wanted and expected from the device. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |4| i love this one | Bought this phone for the full HD 441ppi display, but after getting the phone what impressed me more than the beautiful display was the sound quality. The sound quality provided by the DOLBY ATMOS is REALLY SUPERB. It's extremely good on speakers and even better with a good pair of head phones (mine is Philips djshl3300) (This is unlike what I heard in few reviews and so I had to come here and write this). I found the system to be slightly hot in the beginning but the 2 system updates have solved the heating issue. I would seriously recommend this for people who are looking for a value for money phone for a good multimedia experience. TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH DOLBY ATMOS. ?

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |5| Best Mobile From Lenovo | Bought this for my dad and he is super happy. Looks premium. Display is awesome, however touch sensitivity is bit low, if you put on thick glass screen protector, you will notice some lag.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |4| Amazing... but could improve the battery | it can handle heavy apps and games without lagging. everything runs smoothly. it might heat up in the beginning when you download the software update but that's about it. after that, it is perfect. the only small issue I found is the battery life. it seems to lose 3% battery when left idle for 6 hours without any background apps or internet... plus, it loses 20% battery when used heavily for 3 hours (like playing games or movies). this was pretty much the same battery life I got from my previous phone HTC Desire 516 which had a much smaller battery capacity... I had expected something better from this phone but I guess the battery has to balance out the powerful processor and 2 GB RAM...

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 12 Jun 2016 |3| Average phone | Over all good configuration at the price. Camera is below average. Still waiting for marshmelow update and expecting performance to improve; I have notice it on my Yuphoria, with marshmelow it's battery performance improved and camera quality improved, as well as it's overall responsiveness and performance. I do not get a feel of a Octa-core processor, I felt it not so qucik; my Yuphoria with marshmelllow and quad core was more quicker than this. Hope things will change after marshmellow update for vibe k5.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 04 May 2016 |5| Good Choice | Pleasantly surprised that a Lenovo phone works much better than the Galaxy S4 that I purchased a while ago. Updated as soon as i received and have not seen any overheating what so ever. The android implementation is much cleaner (you have an option to change to android launcher). To me the best parts are - Dual SIM with LTE band 20 support (for Europe), Good battery life, Snappy SD 616 processor, Better in-ear sound, Stable network connectivity and 3G speeds. The not so better ones, while still managable for day to day usage - an OK camera, Some apps (Dialer, Messaging), 32GB SD card support, Only one SIM is 4G and another becomes 2G. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 04 May 2016 |5| Great at dis price | Good Phone At This Price Range ..... Performance Is Good Compared To K4 Note.... Cam Quality OK....Sound Is Good.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 04 May 2016 |4| Excellent Product & DOLBY ATMOS | It was really a good product..bt heating was a little more.. thats no problem.. EVEN.. IPHONE ALSO GETS HEAT DISSIPATION.. Thank you flipkart team.. once again you proved your genuine mark.. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 04 May 2016 |5| Good one in this range | NICE budget phone !!!
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 04 May 2016 |3| Good but can be much Better if Lenovo so desires | Considering the price it's a decent buy . But the UI needs a lot more work and polishing - choppy transitions and the like .... . Call quality is great , so is 4g connectivity - but the cameras are just average . If Lenovo fixes the OS bugs and the cameras by OTA updates within a few months they've surely got a winner on their hands . The display is the best in this price range and the touch response is good , battery life is so so , build quality is great and so is the RAM management . Overall , a good buy if Lenovo rolls out timely updates ! Even though the phone has a powerful processor , it feels sluggish due to the buggy , choppy Vibe UI . Honestly , I would have preferred to have the Lite version of the Vibe UI ! Lastly , they should also increase the shutter speeds of the cameras of this device by an OTA update . 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 03 May 2016 |5| Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus | Nice Phone,The performance offered by the new device is worth a commendation since it is powered by a Snapdragon 616 Octa-core processor that has been clocked at a good speed. The processor has 2 GB of RAM at its disposal to handle running processes, tasks and animations smoothly without any lag. There is a 2750 mAh battery powering the handset for a better backup, which last quite long on a moderate usage.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |5| Worth buying. |Lets come to device:
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |3| lenovo vibe k5+ |As far as my usage this mobile is good if you are not a regular internet user. If you have used 3G connection with in 10 min it heats like anything also I am scaring about to use the 4G N/W since there might be a chance to burn.Camera is working fine.Also I have not played any games since I have not able to check whether this phone is hang or not.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |5| Best Mobile Ever |I would suggest those who are all not using much internet then go for this phone. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |4| Best features | Superb features... with awesome sound using dolby atmos.. Video recording awesome with HD clarity.. No lagging.... Fantastic except some heating issue.. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |3| Strong performer but lacks basics | The bare basic need of being able to hear it "ring" failed us.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |4| Excellent piece. |Even the basic "trring trring" tone was appalling.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |3| Nice But heating |Had to literally hold up the phone to my ear and then hear some inkling of a ring tone.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |2| Bad product |Not sure if this was specific to this one piece though.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |4| phone is good , sound too, but rear camera is not too good |Had to return it. And didnt dare get a replacement. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |5| my lenovo my life with my k5 |On the other hand.. all other hardware was good. Infact better than many other phones i've recently seen. Yes there's heating issues but guess that's expected from the type of hardware running it. Could've been managed better. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |4| Believe it |Camera: OK-OK. Not very great. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |1| Very bad product never gonna buy any lenovo produc | Excellent as a regular phone and social networking usage. Slim n sleek its quite stylish and easy to handle. It is sturdy, well build to sustain a fall, slides well in the pocket. The phone responds well to all actions, screen is large, bright and clear. Keyboard layout is good not crammed as my earlier Samsung that was otherwise also was terribly problematic – as of now I’m very much relieved. The battery life is as true as claimed. After a thorough use it gets to 20-30% at the end of the day. Recharge time is quick. I like the phone and its overall performance, would like to recommend to those looking for a good branded phone at under 10K. This is also my first electronic purchase from flipkart – thanks to them - their service so far has been satisfactory. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 23 Apr 2016 |5| Better mobile | Valuable for money, only disadvantage in this mobile is heating too much, but this range it is good one. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 23 Apr 2016 |3| Vibe k5 plus | its been around 20 days since i m using this phone...it is just below average phone...if u r expecting the high processing speed and good camera in Rs8500 then you will get disappointed with this phone...the only good this about this phone is its sound quality...if u want a phone just to use facebook whatsapp and hike then u can spend your money on this but if u r thinking to play hd games then its nt a good phone for u....

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 21 Apr 2016 |1| worst lenovo Phone |I newly bought this mobile and using it for nearly one month. Since i bought it as a newly launched mobile, I might not get chance to get review from others who used this phone already. As I am using this mobile for a month, i get to know some of the issues with this,such as mobile heating while charging and while on call more than 10 minutes, picture quality is not good for the images taken from this mobile, some of the times the speaker/mike is also not working fine while speaking in phone calls.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 21 Apr 2016 |2| Completly.... disappointed with lenovo.......!!!!!! |

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-dark-grey-16-gb| 21 Apr 2016 |3| low battery backup and heating problems. | Guys.. Who are all having heating issue Try to restrict apps from background app management and you will feel the difference. But there is slight lag while switching screens. Overall it is best mobile for watching videos and for hearing audios.. Expecting update from lenovo for that lag.. Display clarity and Dolby atmos audio is awesome.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 13 May 2016 |5| Absolute Stunner and Impressive | Look : 100/100 - Very good looking phone. Gold color and the finishing is super cool
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 16 May 2016 |3| Good looking phone with some drawbacks |Size : 100/100 - 5.2 Inch is neither big nor small. I can still operate with one hand.. I was using S4 earlier, not so light weight like S4 but still good.
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 25 May 2016 |2| Phone is nice and good, speaker has issue |Battery : 100/100 - S4 power was discharging 1% per minute. When compared to S4, this is too impressive.3100 mAH is outstanding. I am very much impressed with battery. I charged to 100% in the morning at 8.30AM. 3G is continuously ON and i was using Whatsapp, Internet browsing, Now at 12:48 PM, the charge is at 85%.. I am pretty happy about that. I guess the juice will last for the whole day with internet ON.
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 21 May 2016 |2| Heats up when used for Apps using Data |Display : 90/100 - Not so bright and sharp as S series phones, but a real deal for the price. Impressed again. My only worry is about it is not having a Gorilla scratch proof glass. I may need to use tempered glass.

Had raised a return with Flipkart. Flipkart service is so bad that they say to type *#*#4636#*#* to check temperature. The code does not work at all in any samsung mobiles. In addition, as the mobile has no temperature sensor it is totally bluff to verify temperature just by a code or some app.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 12 Jun 2016 |5| Review after 1 week of usage | Review after 1 week of usage : device is working fine. No issues till now as it is big Samsung brand. Small apps multitasking is very easy. Ram is sufficient to handle normal functions. No heat even while charging. Looks are awesome. Display is superb as it is a SAMOLED display. Camera clarity is fine and as per my expectations. Connecting whole day with data connection and in office with wifi but I am easily getting 1.5 day battery. In between listening music around an hour as well. The negatives are USB cable length is too small, headset is basic one, no gorrila glass and taking almost 3-3.5 hours to get full charge as battery is 3100 mah. But above all mobile is fine as negatives are negligible and for display apply tempered glass and if you are music lover so buy another set of headset. But in that price range mobile is best one. 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 11 Jun 2016 |5| Honestly the best device under 15k | Beautiful impressive design easy to handle,Battery backup is awesome. overall below 15k this is the best ever from Samsung & thanks to Flipkart for priority delivery.. 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 10 Jun 2016 |4| Decent budget phone | Good quality phone. Screen is awesome and battery life too is good with latest marshmallow s/w. I got a good cah back on my samsung s2(3K) and there was another 1K off from citibank and Flipkart reverted back another 700Rs on top of this. So for that money i twas worth it.
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 10 Jun 2016 |4| best phone in its segment |Front flash is a handy thing.There was no substantial lag. Both the camera quality was also very decent and up to par. overall iam very satisfied.

I would recommend to look other mobiles like Moto G3, Lenovo, Xiomi, LeEco, or Oppo which offers more features at less price.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 04 Jun 2016 |4| Perfect phone under 15k |The product was very good, no doubt but accessories given by samsung like handsfree are very normal & the same handsfree samsung giving with Rs.1000 keypad phone, so if you buy any smart phone between 14000-15000 range than accessories should by also better.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 02 Jun 2016 |3| Good piece with elegant design for optimal usage | When I ordered this phone, I had kept my expectations low. Delivery was absolute smooth and actually before time. I got it under exchange. I liked phone specifications. Only challenge i feel is borders of mobiles were already scratched. Felt really bad that it doesn't look like new phone. It looks like already used phone. Phone specifications are awesome. Pretty fast and decent for moderate use. I don't play games so I can't rate on that. I removed two stars because of phone body which was having scratehes, color was off.

That's the feature which made me choose this. It has 5.2" screen size which is neither too big nor too small. I bought this phone for my dad. He loved it. The smooth user interface and fast processing made it easy to use. The Samsung customization is heavy and uses up quite aa bit of RAM.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 29 Jun 2016 |1| Heat like a tandoor |so i can say that my experience is very bad with flipkart. 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 29 Jun 2016 |1| Phone locked | Bought this phone for 13.5k on 17th of June, phone was working fine I loved it but after a week problems started to kick in. Firstly screen freezes at times, recent apps panel is not working some times. Sound is too low even if I keep it in my upper pocket sometimes I can't hear the ring tone. There is network connectivity issue as well, I tried using my sim on my other cell(Samsung Galaxy e7) it worked fine but on this one it's not. I raised a return request on 29th at 11:34pm but flipkart rejected that refund request. Now when I checked in with them they suggested me to goto Samsung service center get a job report, click a snapshot of it then send it to flipkart. I'm disgusted by them now, they canceled my return request without even getting it checked as it crossed 10 day return policy now today i.e 30th june return option is not present in my app. So I'm stuck with this faulty mobile, knowing I can't do anything about it. FLIPKART IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PRODUCT, SOMETIMES IT'S YOUR SERVICE THAT FAILS US. IF YOUR BACKEND TEAM HAD NOT CAMCELLED MY REQUEST, THEN EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE. BUT YOU MANAGED TO SCREW IT FOR ME. THANK YOU, I'VE LEARNT A LESSON "IT'S BETTER TO BUY IN A STORE RATHER THAN FLIPKART" 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 28 Jun 2016 |1| Nice Phone | Why the price has been reduced by 1000rs from 13290 to 12290??

Flipkart is constantly delivering this type of bad products to the users .How can u guys become so rude. I know that items like mobile phones need a major effort while returning. Your policy for returning a product is not good. I think this delivered phone is a used one it seems like that

Feel awesome can operate with one hand. Those who say camera is not a good quality is wrong. Camera is exceptional for this price range although better than redmi note 3 and moto g4 plus. All games can played well without any lag. Battery backup is exceptional for normal use... elegant design and premium finish. Last and fore most can move the apps to sd card which all mobiles doesnt have this feature

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 17 Jun 2016 |2| AVERAGE |#Flipkart im not happy with the product. kindly get it return. 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 17 Jun 2016 |5| Good Phone | The J5-6 is a good option provided one understands the limitations. It is futile to compare the phone with other options in the market namely the Moto G4, or even the Moto G3. Surely these options are better in terms of certain feature sets like processor and GPU. However there are few other options in the market with an AMOLED screen at this price point. The phone itself feels premium at this price, with a metal body and looks best in the gold colour option. The screen though is 720px looks sufficiently crisp, and images appear excellent in the saturated AMOLED colours. The let downs are a lack of ambient light sensor and magnetic sensor, which means that you will end up fiddling with the brightness constantly, and also maps will not auto-orient. After heavy 3G usage, the phone was warm, but not too uncomfortable especially given that the sides are metal. The battery is phenomenal, and with moderate usage has lasted me 2 days with multiple email accounts, and Skype going on. There is a bonus of 100GB One drive data storage that will activate if you install any of the microsoft software (Word, Excel, Powerpoint). The Samsung family of apps comes bundled with no way to remove them (expected of course) and they needlessly replicate the google apps. They are definitely polished applications, but it would be better to offer them as free add-ons, rather than mandatorily bundle them using up a good deal of the 16G. An extra SD card is almost mandatory, and there is a separate slot for it apart from the dual SIM slots. The screen seems to be prone to scratching, and is not gorilla glass and a screen guard is also mandatory. The camera does a fair job, and I won't say its better or worse than equally priced competition. One does not buy a phone to replace a DSLR. Selfies are good, which is the main purpose of a phone camera IMHO. Overall the phone is a good product, though at the same price one may be able to obtain other choices with better processor/OS combinations. But choices are what make life interesting, and one must make a conscious choice and be happy with the decision.

Really bad quality. After this flipkart is least interested in taking this phone back. I haven't been contacted from flipkart any time but they r sending sms saying that they have contacted me. Really bad service from flipkart. If this phone is not taken back then i will file a suit against flipkart and samsung 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 12 Jun 2016 |4| worth the money | First about Flipkart. Delivered the pack one day before the mentioned date . What's the bad is the pack delivered by a nearby grocery shop men and not by e-kart person ( even though there is no problem in the pack )telling that he is the distributor of that area that was not professional .

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |1| Worst, Pathetic Shopping Customer Care Service. |4- Main issue is- it shows "Sim card Removed" msg frequently and you have to restart it. There is no other option. Same sim works fine on another mobile. 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |1| BAD SERVICE BY FLIPKART | I have made a lifetime mistake by purchasing this mobile that too with this flipkart. When i requested for a return and refund since this mobile has a heating and hanging issue. They are canceling the return again and again. This customer care guys are completely insane, Their reply is making us mad. If they don't want to accept the return then why the hell they have given that 30 days return option?

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-gold-16-gb| 01 Jun 2016 |5| Good Phone | The earphone quality is absolutely pathetic, not worth more than Rs 20!! The audio quality is absolutely unacceptable. It's as though Samsung wants to punish customers that opted to buy one of it's cheaper phones. Flipkart website also mentions that the phone has noise cancelling headphones,a claim that Samsung refutes. I feel Flipkart meant to say audio cancelling or music destroying headphones!

leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 15 May 2016 |2| Get prepared to become deaf | You simply cannot use this phone to talk for more than 10 min. It is really damaging to the ears. Most annoying thing about the heating is that battery part of device is cooler than top part of the phone where you rest your ear/hold the phone while talking. I fail to understand how this possibly could happen. 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 14 May 2016 |1| Worst Phone in Flipkart... Dont buy.. Its a Ironbox |Using whatsapp/listening to songs when you get a call? don't bother to pick up the call. Close all the apps and wait for 15-20 min to cool down. You can blow air to make it happen faster. 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 30 May 2016 |1| Phone is overheating and bad performance |

leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 13 May 2016 |1| poor Battery and camera issu and over heating |2. With Battery Back up: One day before my return of Le 1s Eco, I charged my phone battery 100% and slept, when i woke up and checked my phone the battery is only 58% for which i am suprised and vexed...
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 22 Jul 2016 |1| Average phone with a very very poor camera | 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 10 Jun 2016 |2| Lousy Battery |So friends i suggest not to buy this phone and get troubles and waste of time.. 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 08 Jun 2016 |1| Unimpressed | Giving 1star just for the quick delivery ,otherwise I would have given a -ve star.
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 15 May 2016 |5| Very nice phone. Decent look. |The product packing is good looks are good but
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 19 May 2016 |1| BAKWAAS (ONLY 1 WORD ) | VERY LOS CAMERA QUILITY, BATTERY GETTING DOWN EARLIER AND HEATING LIKE FRY PAN TOTALLY NOT GOOD........... 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 17 May 2016 |1| Flipkart is not genuine | I got this phone on 14th may and from the same day i started facing many problem. So i just requested return for this product. Then i got a call from flipkart and he told me to send a screenshot of the battery temperature to cs@flipkart.com then i told ok and he kept the call. 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 13 May 2016 |5| LeEco Le 1s Eco must buy |Then immediately i received a mail and message telling that your return request has been rejected since our technical executive has resolved the issue through phone. I dont know how can flipkart can act like this. Were you have solved my problem?? Without my knowledge and without my permission they have closed my query just like that. 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 23 Jun 2016 |2| bad choice | 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 17 May 2016 |1| Flipkart has Photoshoped Mobile display image |Please dont buy this phone and try to avoid doing business with these guys. totally waste
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 13 May 2016 |5| Good phone | 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 23 Jun 2016 |2| bad camera & Heating problem |Dear Flipkart, try to genuine and respect customers satisfaction.If you cant replace or take back my phone its fine just tell it but don't send false mail, this isn't the way of doing business nor proper way to handle a customer query. Try to give proper training to you customer support executives, he knows nothing actually. 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 23 Jun 2016 |3| Average phone | It is very nice budgeted phone..buttery smooth transit from one app to other..for price below 10k its a worth buying phone.

leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 08 Jun 2016 |2| Dont expect for long last battery life | Hi Buyers, 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |1| Not so Good | The quality of the phone is very bad there is lot of noise in the camera and forgot about photos in low light,there are other issues like heating,latency while watching HD videos ,network related issues.to top every thing there is a security issue which will allow to unlock the phone without password when you go to camera from locked home screen and press back button it will take you to the home screen by unlocking it though it happened only few i am unable to reproduce it but this is a very serious issue and most importantly u can't refund even if you don't like the phone there ask for issue and tell they will solve them may be they want users to test the phone and send the issue so that they will try to solve them, and i clearly accept there are lot features for this price range but what i want to tell is they didn't met the minimum quality. 
leeco-le-1s-eco-gold-32-gb| 31 May 2016 |2| improve in camera flash and battery | Guys please think once again buying this phone,

samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 19 Nov 2015 |5| Galaxy On7 | I opened the box and i was like 'WOW'. The design of the phone is very good and sleek. The touch is also good. The battery backup is too good for WiFi users. I did not check it on the mobile data yet. The item was delivered one day late but that is acceptable because of festive season. The photo clarity is good and video recording too. Front cam is good but you need to have enough light focusing on it to take a good selfie. Games doesn't hang much. Overall best phone in 10- 12 k range. 
samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 09 Nov 2015 |4| Excellent phone Samsung on7 | First thing this phone is 'not heating and not hanging'. I am using this mobile from past 3 day's I played lots off games and I used it 2 hour's continually mobile data, its not getting hang and heat. Front and rear both the cameras are good, processor and RAM performance also very good. The good feature is 'ultra data saving', we cannot expect good headphone in Box. 4G is working in ultra speed. Physically looking slim and good. 
samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 07 Nov 2015 |4| Useful review | Everything is okay in this phone but the processor. On5 has a 1.3Gz Exynos processor whereas On7 has a 1.2Gz Snapdragon 410 processor. And it heats sometimes. Mediocre RAM space since Touchwiz UI occupies nearly 700MB of RAM. But, considering the other things it is a good phone at this entry level budget. I kindly recommend this phone (On7) for those who are looking for a decent mobile with one day battery standby. Not for those who are gamers and multitaskers. Camera quality is good and the battery standby is exceptional 
samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 06 Nov 2015 |5| Samsung On7 | Excellent Piece with this budget, Samsung as always Booming this market with this price tags.Good features at this affordable price

samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 04 May 2016 |4| gud | The first phone that I received had some issue with it, every time I tried opening the camera, a message was flashed "media server error, you need to restart the phone" and no metter how many times I restarted, but the same message was flashed. So I asked for a replacement. The technicians visited my home and checked the phone themselves and I was promptly given another new piece within two days (mind you, the 30 days replacement warranty still was in place and was counted from the day the second phone was delivered). Thank you so much Flipkart, I have been a loyal buyer since 2010 and touch wood, my experience has always been sweet :) Keep up the good work. 
samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 04 May 2016 |5| nice | This is one of the first Samsung handset I am using. Previously I had been using Moto handsets and also Windows phone. Every time I though of getting myself a Samsung handset, the user reviews always held me back. Common problems like over heating of handsets, frequent hanging and restart issues were reported by almost all Samsung users whom I know. But this time I thought of giving it a try. I did some research work for 2 days and then finally decided on buying the Samsung Galaxy On7. 
samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 03 May 2016 |5| good mobile | 
samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 03 May 2016 |5| Galaxy On7 Gold |It;s been 2 weeks that I'm using the handset and trust me this is really awesome. No hanging, no overheating, Battery Back up is also great. If you go by the looks, On7 is superb. At least I like the looks very much. Performance wise also, the phone is going great. Till now I didn't insert a SD card because the device's in-built memory is 8GB. Just wanted to check out how it performs without an external memory. And my observations till now - "So Far, So Good".

samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 23 Apr 2016 |4| Samsung ON7 mobile phone | My first android phone was samsung galaxy core. That phone was so disgusting that my respect on samsung just got vanished after using that phone. Though it had 1GB of RAM, the Touchwiz UI ate up all the RAM and the phone lagged like hell. After 1 year of worst experience I finally sold the phone on olx to a samsung lover who was unaware of lagging problem of samsung phones! :P and I sweared to god not to buy any samsung phone again in my life. 
samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 23 Apr 2016 |4| gud product |BUT after 2 yrs, this On and J series launched in market and i heard that samsung updated their touchwiz UI and upgraded RAM to 1.5 GB. Now, I had to buy a phone for my father who believes in branded products and used a samsung phone for almost 4 years and before that used nokia. Though at first I thought to buy him a ASUS max or Redmi note 3, but after much consideration i purchased this product for him! Seriously speaking, I am astonished after seeing this performance from samsung.

samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 29 Mar 2016 |4| A truly amazing device |Overall,the phone is sturdy and is the best at this price range. If you are confused about moto g 3rd gen,xiomi note 3 and this,I highly suggest samsung galaxy On7. 
samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |5| Samsung On7 | The Samsung On7 is a truly amazing device. Samsung has taken care to ensure that the battery backup does not leave any room for complaint. The device does not lag,the screen is excellent and only the necessary apps are preloaded. I would go so far as to say that given this device is available at just over 10th, why go for Samsung J7? The only reservation I have is that there is no call divert option.

samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 23 Mar 2016 |4| Galaxy On 7 Indian Sims only | recently bought Galaxy On7 from Flipkart. The bax had a sticker Indian Sims only. If you want to use any other local sim travelling abroad , you need to use indian sim for minimum 5 minutes @ Rs. 200/- per minute is a huge cost. That too in each country you are visiting. So if you are going abroad do not buy this fone. otherwise its a good fone to use within India

samsung-galaxy-on7-gold-8-gb| 16 Mar 2016 |5| A fantastic phone in all aspects | Now having used Galaxy on7 for more than a month, I'm fully satisfied with the performance of it. I'd start with its look which is very premium and appears classy and stylish. Coming to the performance of this phablet, it delivers on every aspect be it the '' amazing battery life'' or the 4G speed which is fabulous. I'm not a game person so would be unable to comment on this aspect, but it does not hang even while multitasking. The rear camera is nice but it has a fantastic front camera giving you amazing selfies. It gives you adequate space to download applications and memory is expandable up to 128GB through sd card, which is a boon for movie buffs and video addicts. Flipkart service is amazing as mobile got delivered to me before the prescribed time and date. Thanks Samsung for this classy mobile at such a low price with almost every feature and Flipkart for its swift service.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Mar 2016 |4| Premium phone with good processor and display |Ordered this phone as a gift for my mom on 23rd As soon as the flash sale went online. I HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 06 Apr 2016 |1| Not good phone | Lots of issue
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Mar 2016 |4| Decent One except battery life...! |1)It can be used for ironing cloths
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Mar 2016 |3| Phone is good, but overheating while charging |2)Antic camera (such camera used in 1980)
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 30 Mar 2016 |2| Overheats |3)I think Flipkart is not aware of it's specification
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 09 Jun 2016 |1| Pathetic Phone and after sales service |4)Without knowing mobile performance they put F Advantage,now it is removed 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 04 Apr 2016 |2| Good but heating issue and battery | Display is good, viewing angles are fine, minor lags occurs but they are negligible, Camera is not upto the mark , low light and indoor photos seem to be too noisy. battery gets charged in less than 2 hrs and 1.5 A output charger does it job fine but not that great. Battery life is something which should be improved. Continuous usage of 5 hours reduced the battery from 100 to 25% Design and look are fine. Hope lenovo releases an update for improving performance of battery and camera .Audio is simply superb, dolby does it job well. Overall Its a decent phone for its price, it performs good for normal usage and not recommended for heavy users.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 01 Apr 2016 |1| Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 27 Mar 2016 |1| Returning.... |Lenevo building their brand with success of K3 and K4 note in recent times. Never expected this.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 27 Mar 2016 |4| Only Good |On paper Lenevo K5 looks stunning, actually its not!!!
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |1| Poor Camera Quality | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 29 Mar 2016 |1| Blunder |Over all, Don't waste your and money. Spend on good things. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 02 Apr 2016 |1| Dnt buy it | Processor is 1.5 GHz + Qualcomm Snapdragon 616, Octa Core but they have described as 1.7GHz. it is getting heat in very quick time. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 08 Apr 2016 |1| piece of shit for 8500Rs | Not worthy to buy even at 4000. Battery drains like we drink juice through a straw. Hardly lasts for half a day. and it heats so much that we can probably prepare an omlet on the back of the phone. Lot of lag while opening and switching between applications. wish there was a zero star rating. But unfortunately I have to give it one star. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 02 Apr 2016 |1| Worst Mobile I have purchased from Flipkart | Never expected the cheap quality from Lenovo.They feel customers are granted and blindly buy all mobiles from lenovo.I bought 2 lenovo k5 plus and to my surprise to see worst Camara ,Batter drains out fast,If I use Internet and play some games for 10 minutes it gets heats like anything.I requested customer they replied saying reset the phone it will be alright.Even after reset issues remained same.asked for refund and waiting 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 02 Apr 2016 |1| Worthless product | • Camera specification is fake, poor image quality
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 27 Mar 2016 |1| camera and battery is not well |• Heating problem, phone heats very quickly

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 20 Jun 2016 |1| good but not at all |• If you ask for return, flipkart will refuse and seller will disapprove your return request 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 18 Jun 2016 |1| Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus versus Swipe Elite Plus |• Don’t waste your money on this phone 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 17 Jun 2016 |2| LENOVO VIBE K5 PLUS | In this product the camera and the battery is very bad when i would like to return my product the flipkart seller had call me and tell to check battery temperature is 45 is more or not but when i check it is nearly 47.5degrees to 48.5degrres. so i would to return my product.all the features are very nice compare to others. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 09 Jun 2016 |5| Best Phone - A must buy | Bought it after seeing the flash sale. Heating, battery is major issue. Flipkart, Recall all K5 vibe to save your brand value. How this mobile is consider for flash sale. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Apr 2016 |3| Earphone | product is not so good but its cost to product is good. i love it. but i don't used anymore. over hitting, low GPU, some lagging probs, low quality camera but not bad, gyro sensor problems, it's low price mobile but good quality i like it
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 27 Apr 2016 |3| Good phone with issue of heating problems | first of thanks to flipkart to give me good delivery on perfect time. packing also very goof.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 26 Apr 2016 |3| Low battery backup and Heating problem |I am using this phone from 2nd of april
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |4| All are good but over hitting issue |touch is very good.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 16 Apr 2016 |1| Worst Phone i have ever had |ui is very good.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 11 Apr 2016 |1| heating issue |sound is very good.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 08 Apr 2016 |1| over heating issue |Only one big issue is heating after playing game or browsing for 20 minutes.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 08 Apr 2016 |1| DONT WESTE YOUR MONEY |Dont tell me for ota upgrade because i already two upgrade which one for 93 MB and second 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 06 Apr 2016 |4| about phone |58 MB. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 02 Apr 2016 |3| Good but not that good! | I have purchased this phone month before, but I am facing serious heating problem and battery backup issue.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |4| LENEVO VIBE K5 PLUS | Received within 3 days of order placed. In time delivery of product is appreciated but about Lenevo Vibe K5 Plus, the Camera is not very good as expected and heating problem is there. Touch is good & sound is very good. Weight is also very light. Good phone in this range but heating issue need to be resolved by the manufacturer. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Apr 2016 |5| A good device for a reasonable price | I took a huge risk even with so many negative issues and purchased this phone. You know what? I am glad I listened to my inner feelings rather than the reviews! 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 01 Apr 2016 |2| good ...it order when price fall down lillle bit more |First thing I will address - the phone does heat up, but it does as much as is expected from a metal clad phone. Nothing abnormal. The phone prompted for a 93 MB update soon after I connected it with my home Wi-Fi network and I installed it. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to use this phone as a "heating pan" or for "omelette" as some have claimed they did.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 29 Mar 2016 |1| devastated |Secondly, the battery life is reasonable and it should easily last a day under moderate usage. There are NO battery drain issues. Call quality is great and there have been no call drops for me so far.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 29 Mar 2016 |1| HEATING LIKE HELL !!!! |Third, for photography - it captures very good pics with good amount of detail under good lighting conditions but there is some noise in low light. This is a very typical smartphone camera performance in the low to mid-range.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 27 Mar 2016 |2| not worth, its like iron box, |Fourth point, the listing for Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus CLEARLY MENTIONS the "IN THE BOX CONTENTS" as I quote, "Handset, 2-pin Wall Charger, USB Cable, Battery", unquote. It's incredible that so many folks were disappointed that "they did not find headphones in the box."
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |1| phone or heater..wrost phone |I personally believe that for low to mid-range smartphones, you must have your expectations right. For example, this device runs heavy games like Mortal Kombat, Fifa and Asphalt 8 just fine, but only at low to medium settings.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |1| Waste Mobile Money Waste Time waste |Now, being a mid-range device there are bound to be shortcomings. For example, Lenovo could have included some carry case or cover for phone in the box - the device is, plainly put - slippery. I am waiting for the cover I have ordered. The phone looks rather bland from the front and capacitive buttons on the front are not backlit.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |2| Flipkart has given false configuration |Though the inclusion of Dolby Atmos is great, the positioning of speakers on the back is disappointing. I believe the front had a lot of bezels above and below the display and the speakers should have been accommodated there, just like in Vibe K4 Note or Vibe X3.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Mar 2016 |1| Donot buy | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |2| Good but not best | Overall product is ok but not the best. this time Lenovo really make fool to Indian people by saying that they use Snapdragon 616 processor 1.7 Ghz octa core The processor was a Qualcomm Snapdragon but was disappointed to find 1.5 GHz Processor instead of 1.7GHz as mentioned here, also you get 1.8Gb of RAM instead of 2Gb.asks you to choose your default 4G/3G SIM after which the other SIM automatically gets assigned to 2G network which is very annoying 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 04 Apr 2016 |2| Over Heating issue not solved even after software upgrade | The phone is really good from all aspects except the major heating problem, which still remains even after the latest software update of 119mb. Phone gets heated within 3-4mins of normal usage and burns the ear if you receive or make calls. Rest the product is really nice. But this overheating problem being really intolerable, I am going to return the product. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Mar 2016 |3| best budget phone with little heating effect | This phone is good at this price range. Camera (both front and back), sound, display, look, touch response and everything is very good except it has some heating effect. This is the review after using one whole day. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |3| Dolby disappointment | I bought Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus only for Dolby but very much disappointed (too much Treble and low Bass -- not good enough).
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 16 Jun 2016 |2| Heats like Fry pan. U can cook egg on its back | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Mar 2016 |3| Bad Camera Quality. |I own a Lenovo Vibe K4 Note as well which has truly amazing Dolby effect. I am using Samsung E0-EG920BBEGIN In-Ear headphones (Rs929) with both K4 note and K5 Plus.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Mar 2016 |4| Good phone.. | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 06 Apr 2016 |2| Heating Problem |If you are a music lover and buying for Dolby experience, I'd recommend you to avoid this phone and go for K4 Note. In all other respects, Vibe K5 plus is great buy.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |1| Not a good one.... | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |1| over all dispointed |Pros
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |1| heating problem | heats up like an oven. rest is alll good but it gets heated up just after 5mins of casual use 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Mar 2016 |1| So Much Disappointment for Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus | Received the next day after 23 March sale , thanks to flipkart to deliver quickly.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 01 May 2016 |1| not satisfied |Look is very good.(Golden).
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |4| editted : mm...satisfied after update of 119mb | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |1| Below Average Camera and Heating Issues. |The most disappointment one is battery and heating issue.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Mar 2016 |3| Avg |I have phones Lenovo p1 and Lenovo p1m both are very good, but this phone heats like anything like a iron box. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Mar 2016 |4| Good phone by today's gargantuan standards |Coming to battery charged the mobile from (56% to 100% ) in 2.45 hours( Very tough to wait for charging 44%). 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 31 May 2016 |5| Go for it |After 100% charging the batter says 4 hours left( That means 4 hours for 100% charging?)
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 15 Apr 2016 |1| waste of time and money |The speed where it charges is equal to time which discharges.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 30 Mar 2016 |5| i just love this mobile |Very disappointment.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 30 Mar 2016 |5| My honest review, I am fully satisfied | I generally do not give rating 5 to any one unless it is really good
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 29 Mar 2016 |4| Good phone for price range..but do not expect too much | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |5| Good buy |Excellent phone in this range, display is awesome, Battery is good, performance is good, overall phone is good, I was waiting from a long time to buy a phone like this, I do not want to buy a phone which is 5.5 inches, this is handy easy to carry and manage do this too much just grab it. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 27 Mar 2016 |2| Product in such price is good | I purchased the gold version.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 26 Mar 2016 |3| poor battery and camera along with heating issue |The phone has a nice look and screen is above average. Lots of preloaded app (whether thats good or bad is upto you).
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Mar 2016 |1| Do not Buy! |The Camera is decent but there are better camera around for this price range. My suggestion is to use other Camera apps than the stock one.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 23 Jul 2016 |5| Awesome Phone |As soon as I hooked up to the WiFi..there were two system updates provided. My guess it is bug fixes as I dont see version upgrade.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 18 Jul 2016 |3| Over Heating |I played games for 30 mins and it is hot as hell(so you can see the quality of hardware).
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 15 Jul 2016 |4| Review almost after14 days |On heavy games or applications, the battery drains like water in hot summer sun.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |5| May be my review help u... |But on casual to moderate use it easily lasts for 1 day and a little more.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |5| Excellent Phone - in Budget range | Excellent phone in budget range, will recommend surely to others, also price wise Vibe K5 also Ok, 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |1| "Battery is pathetic & Heating Issue is present" |Plus version dont have much variance (having Full HD Display)

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 15 Jun 2016 |3| Nice but not good | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Jun 2016 |4| Good value for the money you spend. |battery will stay for a day with full internet usage, other wise got upto 40 hrs 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jun 2016 |1| Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus | Apart from the specifications of the phone which are quite satisfactory, the phone has two major drawbacks/problems.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 02 May 2016 |4| Good to buy | The phone heats up even when idle. Uncomfortable to hold. Poor battery, doesn't last a day. Worst camera in this price range. Flipkart denied return, denied the phone overheats. Lenovo says that overheating should be considered normal, whereas it is a serious health hazard. I emailed Flipkart Resolution, but received no response. All I am left with is 8k worth of overheating brick that I will not be using (or gifting). Will never buy from Flipkart and Lenovo ever again.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 04 Apr 2016 |1| review |Camera: Good Quality camera. I have seen some reviews saying lack of camera quality, but the camera quality is really good. There is a cover at the back of the camera, you have to first remove that, failing in that might be a reason for bad reviews about camera quality.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 31 Mar 2016 |1| Very poor display and clarity |It has a 1.5A rated charger, mainly used for phablets. It feels little heated while charging, I'll rephrase, it does not feel like iron. My other phone nexus 4 gets more heat than this. Phone getting 'little' heat 'sometimes' is pretty normal these days, it's not Nokia world anymore. People who've owned Android previously can correlate this. Besides it's an octa core processor.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 28 Mar 2016 |4| Worth the Money | So far so good. Have been using this phone for over a week. Nothing so great to mention about except its brilliant dispaly and excellent sound. Battery life is also good. What we get at this price is quite satisfactory. So far I have not faced any problem. Some users mentioned about over heating but i dont observe any over heating in my phone. No extra or special feature to mention about. Camera quality is good. Not very great pics in dark. Front cam is better than expected. Vibe UI is not so apealing. Needs to be refined. Overall looks and feel of the phone is good. Easy to hold and lightweight. The back cover which company claims to be of aluminum actually looks like plastic. Processor is also 1.5 Ghz not 1.7 Ghz. Out of 16GB inbuild memory about 12 GB is available for user. And its not 4G/4G. Only one sim 4G. Overall a good phone for normal users. This phone is not for gamers.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |4| Solid one for the price | purchased 2 P1M and this vibe k5+ for my wife and sisters. on the whole the phone performance and features are really good if we put it into context of the price tag it comes with, the only complaint with both phones is, ring volume goes down automatically and with high volume setting too it is pretty low.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |4| no return policy from flipkart | during purchase you will see that 10 day replacement is available. But actually flipkart not did so. My phone is having battery backup and heating issue but phone not replaced. Gaming is smooth but mobile heat badly and baterry drain rapidly those i did OTG update. So unable to play game like nova3 for long period. If you not play games, still batery backup is poor you have to chagre mobile twice in 12 hours. Else screen is very nice but not 5 inch disply. Display is 4.5inch and total phone is 5.5 inch. If we left battery and heating issue then phoe is best. Connect your phone with remote and play game with vr glass. Experience is very superb 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |2| Bought with really good expection..But no use!!! | Its very sluggish handset in terms of UI. Rear Camera Qualiy is very Poor . Device slightly lags!!! If u want to buy Cell phone under 8K . Then this would be the good option to buy for normal usage 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |5| Lenova K5 Plus | Wow , I have Ordered and received a Lenova K5 Plus. It was amazing performance and good product delivered by flipkart . In this mobile was reasonable price for this high performance. Once again thanks Flipkart. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |3| K5 Plus | The product is very good. But the unfortunate thing is that FLIPKART has sent me a piece which is damaged. I wonder how do they miss to check out if the piece is good or not. How could they just send it and then now when i give a complain about it they say they need 3 days to work on it. When they could send the product in a day why cant the resolution be provided in a day? 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 14 Jul 2016 |3| Everything else Camera is good. | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |5| Reliable |Products are good with flipkart but the delay in service is disappointing even after explaining the emergency of the requirement. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Nice phone | This is nice after update no heating issues touch little bit low camera too. other than this is best phone ... 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Amazing phone.... | After all camera is excellent...i loved the phone ...design is amazing...full on i phone look..im really happy and will suggest to take it ...just having little but problem of heating

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |3| Lenovo K5 Plus Review | The phone is good but the heating issue is something that cannot be overlooked. Also the radiation level of the phone is quite high (Lower than other COSTLY phones) which is severely impacting pregnant women. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Great Purchase | No complain about the delivery of the product. The Phone itself is a good one. No heating problem. But its camera is a poor one, specially the Flash. If a snap is taken with flash it becomes too hazy. Without flash in low light the picture is not prominent. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Nice phone under 8.5K | The mobile is pretty, practical and easy to use. I have so many reviews about people saying it has heating issues, but did not find any. Its performance is fast and response is good. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Future Regular Buyer to FlipKart | As many people have already given their reviews, I will try not to repeat and as short and precise as possible. These are my observations and may differ for any other person. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus |Look and feel: 4.5/5
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |5| Excellent phone |Great aluminium casing, great touch sense. Touch sense has some problem at upper edge when sliding down for settings. Better to use tempered glass instead of screen guard that comes with the phone. Feeling of an iphone for Golden color handset. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| value for money | So far so good..delivery of the product was well before schedule date. Have been using this phone for past 8 days. It seem to be working fine, speed is good, touch is good, overall performance good. Value for money. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |4| Good phone at a budget price. | I didnt find the over heating issue after installing the updates as was stated in the reviews by many buyers. I am already using a one plus phone and the heat is almost the same for both. But i had network connectivity issues. I got that phone replaced and the new one was working absolutely perfect. A great phone at a great budget. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 13 Jul 2016 |5| AWESOME MOBILE | awesome phn ever i used... it has great processor with great high sound with dolby sound option..... just camera is normal... but expect camera.... every feature in mobile is great in lowest price

Best budget phone worth to buy. Thanks to flipkart.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| All is well |I have observed some issue with that phone:
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| A Good product in the price range |1. In gaming it has heating issue.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| one of the best handset |2. Camera Quality is not so good, it is above the average but not good.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| EA - Exceeded all Expectations, Rating 1. | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| Fantastic phone at an unrealistic price |But Front Camera is better than other phones, If you are crazy about selfies then it is good for you.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |4| Just what I want. | First off, the incredible heating issue. As soon as the phone was switched on, it started and the device got as hot as an iron. However, as soon as update was completed, switched off and fully charged, issue was resolved. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 12 Jul 2016 |5| In love with this phone |Phone looks very good, is very slim and bright. Fast and responsive, battery seems OK so far, and 10 GB usable internal memory is just fine for me. I like things simple so UI is quite OK for me. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |3| dont purchase |Camera is so so and not so sharp but if I want to take pictures I'd buy an SLR camera instead, so it's livable with. I've not played games with it but I prefer to play games on a PC rather than a phone so that's OK for me.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |2| Do not waste money for this phone |All in all I'm satisfied. Just what I wanted and expected from the device. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |4| i love this one | Bought this phone for the full HD 441ppi display, but after getting the phone what impressed me more than the beautiful display was the sound quality. The sound quality provided by the DOLBY ATMOS is REALLY SUPERB. It's extremely good on speakers and even better with a good pair of head phones (mine is Philips djshl3300) (This is unlike what I heard in few reviews and so I had to come here and write this). I found the system to be slightly hot in the beginning but the 2 system updates have solved the heating issue. I would seriously recommend this for people who are looking for a value for money phone for a good multimedia experience. TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH DOLBY ATMOS. ?

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 11 Jul 2016 |5| Best Mobile From Lenovo | Bought this for my dad and he is super happy. Looks premium. Display is awesome, however touch sensitivity is bit low, if you put on thick glass screen protector, you will notice some lag.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |3| Battery and Camera performance bad | Its ok.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 06 Jul 2016 |4| Amazing... but could improve the battery | it can handle heavy apps and games without lagging. everything runs smoothly. it might heat up in the beginning when you download the software update but that's about it. after that, it is perfect. the only small issue I found is the battery life. it seems to lose 3% battery when left idle for 6 hours without any background apps or internet... plus, it loses 20% battery when used heavily for 3 hours (like playing games or movies). this was pretty much the same battery life I got from my previous phone HTC Desire 516 which had a much smaller battery capacity... I had expected something better from this phone but I guess the battery has to balance out the powerful processor and 2 GB RAM...

Still waiting for marshmelow update and expecting performance to improve; I have notice it on my Yuphoria, with marshmelow it's battery performance improved and camera quality improved, as well as it's overall responsiveness and performance. I do not get a feel of a Octa-core processor, I felt it not so qucik; my Yuphoria with marshmelllow and quad core was more quicker than this. Hope things will change after marshmellow update for vibe k5.

I previously used A6000Plus that was also very good one change it as I wanted both 4G facility and this one with just 1k hike really worth it. Would have given it 5 stars but later maybe, just using for 2 days...

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 04 May 2016 |5| Good Choice | Pleasantly surprised that a Lenovo phone works much better than the Galaxy S4 that I purchased a while ago. Updated as soon as i received and have not seen any overheating what so ever. The android implementation is much cleaner (you have an option to change to android launcher). To me the best parts are - Dual SIM with LTE band 20 support (for Europe), Good battery life, Snappy SD 616 processor, Better in-ear sound, Stable network connectivity and 3G speeds. The not so better ones, while still managable for day to day usage - an OK camera, Some apps (Dialer, Messaging), 32GB SD card support, Only one SIM is 4G and another becomes 2G. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 04 May 2016 |5| Great at dis price | Good Phone At This Price Range ..... Performance Is Good Compared To K4 Note.... Cam Quality OK....Sound Is Good.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 04 May 2016 |5| Good one in this range | NICE budget phone !!!
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 04 May 2016 |3| Good but can be much Better if Lenovo so desires | Considering the price it's a decent buy . But the UI needs a lot more work and polishing - choppy transitions and the like .... . Call quality is great , so is 4g connectivity - but the cameras are just average . If Lenovo fixes the OS bugs and the cameras by OTA updates within a few months they've surely got a winner on their hands . The display is the best in this price range and the touch response is good , battery life is so so , build quality is great and so is the RAM management . Overall , a good buy if Lenovo rolls out timely updates ! Even though the phone has a powerful processor , it feels sluggish due to the buggy , choppy Vibe UI . Honestly , I would have preferred to have the Lite version of the Vibe UI ! Lastly , they should also increase the shutter speeds of the cameras of this device by an OTA update . 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 03 May 2016 |5| Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus | Nice Phone,The performance offered by the new device is worth a commendation since it is powered by a Snapdragon 616 Octa-core processor that has been clocked at a good speed. The processor has 2 GB of RAM at its disposal to handle running processes, tasks and animations smoothly without any lag. There is a 2750 mAh battery powering the handset for a better backup, which last quite long on a moderate usage. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 03 May 2016 |5| Good... | Good... 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 03 May 2016 |3| Average Phone | Good look,body is nice,charge fast,front camera is good but back camera is not good compare as K3.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 02 May 2016 |4| good | to those people who are talking abut the phone getting heated up..i even owe an iphone 6 which gets heated up sometimes... pls use cases as ita a metal phone..otherwise its good..the screen size could have been 5.5" and a fingerprint scanner would have made wonders...

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |5| Worth buying. |Lets come to device:
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |3| lenovo vibe k5+ |As far as my usage this mobile is good if you are not a regular internet user. If you have used 3G connection with in 10 min it heats like anything also I am scaring about to use the 4G N/W since there might be a chance to burn.Camera is working fine.Also I have not played any games since I have not able to check whether this phone is hang or not.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |5| Best Mobile Ever |I would suggest those who are all not using much internet then go for this phone. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |4| Best features | Superb features... with awesome sound using dolby atmos.. Video recording awesome with HD clarity.. No lagging.... Fantastic except some heating issue.. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |3| Strong performer but lacks basics | The bare basic need of being able to hear it "ring" failed us.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |4| Excellent piece. |Even the basic "trring trring" tone was appalling.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 25 Apr 2016 |3| Nice But heating |Had to literally hold up the phone to my ear and then hear some inkling of a ring tone.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |2| Bad product |Not sure if this was specific to this one piece though.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |4| phone is good , sound too, but rear camera is not too good |Had to return it. And didnt dare get a replacement. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |5| my lenovo my life with my k5 |On the other hand.. all other hardware was good. Infact better than many other phones i've recently seen. Yes there's heating issues but guess that's expected from the type of hardware running it. Could've been managed better. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |4| Believe it |Camera: OK-OK. Not very great. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 24 Apr 2016 |1| Very bad product never gonna buy any lenovo produc | Excellent as a regular phone and social networking usage. Slim n sleek its quite stylish and easy to handle. It is sturdy, well build to sustain a fall, slides well in the pocket. The phone responds well to all actions, screen is large, bright and clear. Keyboard layout is good not crammed as my earlier Samsung that was otherwise also was terribly problematic – as of now I’m very much relieved. The battery life is as true as claimed. After a thorough use it gets to 20-30% at the end of the day. Recharge time is quick. I like the phone and its overall performance, would like to recommend to those looking for a good branded phone at under 10K. This is also my first electronic purchase from flipkart – thanks to them - their service so far has been satisfactory. 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 23 Apr 2016 |5| Better mobile | Valuable for money, only disadvantage in this mobile is heating too much, but this range it is good one.

Overall it is a good phone if you want to spend below 10k.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 22 Apr 2016 |5| Experience a new review . | 
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 21 Apr 2016 |1| worst lenovo Phone |I newly bought this mobile and using it for nearly one month. Since i bought it as a newly launched mobile, I might not get chance to get review from others who used this phone already. As I am using this mobile for a month, i get to know some of the issues with this,such as mobile heating while charging and while on call more than 10 minutes, picture quality is not good for the images taken from this mobile, some of the times the speaker/mike is also not working fine while speaking in phone calls.
lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 21 Apr 2016 |2| Completly.... disappointed with lenovo.......!!!!!! |

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 21 Apr 2016 |3| low battery backup and heating problems. | Guys.. Who are all having heating issue Try to restrict apps from background app management and you will feel the difference. But there is slight lag while switching screens. Overall it is best mobile for watching videos and for hearing audios.. Expecting update from lenovo for that lag.. Display clarity and Dolby atmos audio is awesome.

lenovo-vibe-k5-plus-golden-16-gb| 01 Apr 2016 |4| Best at this price. All in one. | I ordered it first day of its launch within few minutes. Flipkart delivery is very fast it comes in 48 hrs ..after using it by 5days I feel it is not advisable to buy it due to it overheating.. Camera is also not up to the mark...as I used before lenovo series A6000 & k3 note are never had a heating problem..

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 11 Jul 2015 |5| Killer Phone BUT | Yes. All the fuzz about it being a KillerNote is true. It is an awesome phone at really low price. But there are some things that didn't stand out very well. Lemme put it all in points.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2015 |4| Trusted Review |I am going to compare it with Note 3(current cost Rs 30K, cost when I bought Rs 45K!)
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |5| awsome phone with great performance | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 30 Jul 2015 |5| BEST BUY...Go for it without a second thought!!! |1) Display: I didn't expect the display to be good. But, it is vivid and pleasure to use though the contrast can never be compared with AMOLED display. This is the best part of K3 Note.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Jul 2015 |2| Not worth the HYPE | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2015 |5| awsome phone on this price..... |2) Camera: OK camera. Bit laggy and lot of over processing done . For selfies it seems to be better than Galaxy Note 3
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 07 Aug 2015 |1| Lenovo K3 Note Camera | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Jul 2015 |1| Battery to difficult to take out!! |3) Performance: No issues and lags in regular use. But, you can see the occasional frame drops when there is lot of IO(like update or install of apps in the BG). I see this in a Galaxy Note 3 as well. But never try to use features like Secure zone and expect it to perform. It lags like hell when you enable secure zone. 2GB RAM is not enough for this feature.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Jul 2015 |2| not satisfacted | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Jul 2015 |1| Lots of Missing | Although it is said that the phone has a 3.5mm audio jack but no 3.5mm earphones can be plugged in completely it falls out.Processing is slow and camera is crap blurred video etc. Using this half day came this much to note don't know whats ahead Display is awesome 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Jul 2015 |4| A very good device for the Price | as many of the reviewers have stated before me how great the device is. i will not go into the details much but will point out some pros and cons of this phablet and compare it with my oneplus one

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Aug 2015 |1| hang |lets start with the pros of K3 note.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |2| BAD EXPERIENCE-LENOVO SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO PROVIDE BETTER PRODUCT |1. Display, the display is crisp and vivid, its accurate and the colour reproduction is accurate. the viewing angles are good but not great. you will not find a reason to complain and there is a option to boost display brightness in sunlight under settings. it needs to be tested as i have not seen the sun due to rains in past 2 days of getting device. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |5| 15+ hours battery and still 5% remaining | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Jul 2015 |1| TOUCH NOT WORKING AND SERVICE CENTRE NEED 25 DAYS FOR REPAIR |2. Build is good and the soft touch back is nice to hold, its same build and look of A6000, A7000 and i do not see the reason to complain the vol and power buttons are metal and thats good. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Jul 2015 |5| belive in lenovo k3 note | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Jul 2015 |1| pathetic when it comes to basic features |3. Sensors which are needed are present, you have double tap to wake and gesture controls. there is no tap to sleep. i admire the fact that lenovo has given proper sensors and led notification light. it has gyro, accelerometer, magnetometer, orientation sensor, gravity sensor, light and proximity sensor and all of them work well. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |3| Headphones missing, Camera photo quality is not good |

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |4| good phone with some manageable quirks | con:
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Jul 2015 |5| Killer phone at killer prize |i have both a7000 and k3 ...what i notice is that screen color is more towards the colder side in k3 i.e white will look more like bluish white in this.( i would have preferred more neutral tone but screen clarity and viewing angle is awesome)
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 22 Aug 2015 |1| Touchscreen is a Big Problem. |charging time is a big problem. (battery 2900)
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 16 Aug 2015 |5| Chat applications NOT working |speaker sound is shit in both the phone...u will find problem to hear the voice through the phone earpiece if u are at some busy place.(call quality is less on our side)
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |3| Good phone but need some fixes in Software |ram available is less in k3 compared to a7000.(though this never affected the performance)
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |3| BUDGET NOTE |network signal strength in a7000 and k3 is comparatively less than the other phones it fluctuates a lot which never happened with my moto g or samsung basic phone.(but again till now i dont have face any problem of no network but consider this fact also that i live in central mumbai )

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Jul 2015 |3| Heating Problem |so just take this things into consideration.....no doubt this is a good phone for the price we are paying but it can be better if they would have included fast charging and better earpiece 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Jul 2015 |5| awesomeeeeee really a killer | K3 note is really a killer phone,this can be comparable with the flagship killer oneplusone.I got a score 45969 on antutu and in geekbench in single core 804 and in multi core 4087 which is amazing for this prize and if anyone is confused b/w k3 and mi4i then k3 beat in every department expect camera.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Jul 2015 |5| The best under 10k Mobile of 2015. |Either the battery is bad or the battery slot suffers from a manufacturing defect.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 03 Aug 2015 |1| Very much disappointed from product as well as from Flipkart ... | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 23 Jul 2015 |2| 2 GB RAM A Myth!!!!!!! | Lenovo Guys
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Jul 2015 |3| Awesome Mobile but product delivery is bullshit | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Jul 2015 |5| Killer in all aspects |Where is my 2 GB RAM?????? even with no apps installed i hardly get 968 MB ram to use.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |4| Better than competition | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Dec 2015 |1| see my review before buying. |Half of the RAM is used by Lenovo OS.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Aug 2015 |5| super mobile | light weight ,front camera is good,rear camera is damn good,it is a good phone for day to day users.there is no lag in phone , pre installed app irritates us .its a good phone for music lovers not for gamers 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 13 Aug 2015 |5| killer note is WORTH buying!!! | best budget phone excellent display runs without lag no heating issues but a you really cant customize much in the home screen except that its awesome 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 02 Aug 2015 |5| Cutting the crap!! | Got the phone on 16th of July. Keeping in mind that the phone costs just INR 10,000 I'd say it functions pretty well. Please do not have lofty aspirations when you buy this device. It offers way too much at the price point it is selling. The performance is decent with a minor lag sometimes and that too when I have multiple apps open in the background. The device does not heat up like an oven. If you look at it's cpu, you would agree that a little heat will be generated.So stop complaining about it. It wont give you third degree burns!! The camera is moderately ok. Looking for DSLR quality pics? Go ahead and buy a DSLR and not a phone! The display is sturdy enough even though there is no gorilla glass. The colours are more or less accurate and not washed out and full HD screen is always a treat. Aesthetics are ok. I do not play graphics intensive games so cannot comment on that. All in all the phone is worth your time and money. Don't use some expensive device and then expect the same performance from this. And those who are shouting about this being a re branded Chinese device (found that under the 1 star rating column) and is being marketed by lenovo without any prior testing whatsoever and clamouring for the new moto g3 in regards to it's build performance et al, both the phones are from lenovo. Motorola is owned by lenovo. google it. So if lenovo wanted to screw you big time they already would have. As for the high SAR value..use a earphone guys.. it is a 5.5 inch device..makes sense to use a hands free to talk. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 25 Jul 2015 |3| Everything is good except the time taken for recharging. | Bought a K3 Note White on flash sale.A very good phone for such a low cost.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Jul 2015 |5| Awesome Phone - Thanks to Lenovo |9.I suggest to use a tempered glass for screen as the screen guard offered with it is not good,very this n doesnt give protection to phone...

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Dec 2015 |1| Don't Buy Lenovo | Worst product ever seen. I have purchased the Lenove K 3 note online from flipkart thinking that Lenovo is a branded company which will maintain quality. Even though my friends had advised not to buy Lenovo , I have made a mistake. The set was purchased on 1st september 2015. On 28th December 2015, the touch pad is not working. I went to the Authorised service centre in Ahmedabad wherein I found there are almost all the cases have touch screen problem. The service in the authorised centre is worst as it took two hours to hand over the set to them. To my surprise they have told that it will take a month to get it reparied. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 13 Dec 2015 |1| Defective pieces. Don't purchase |Is this the way Lenovo service is working ? By capturing the market with less price they have compromised the quality of the product. I advise all you Guys do not buy any LENOVO product.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 11 Aug 2015 |3| Good Budget Phone with few compromises |5 Days Back i took Lenovo K3 note from Flipkart, this mobile getting lot of Heat issues while browsing & talking. Any body facing Same issue with this cell ? Or in my cell only any Problem. Please help me out friends Depends on yours reply I will exchange or return this mobile to Flipkart. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 11 Aug 2015 |2| No headset in the box | Hi,
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Aug 2015 |4| Great phone around 10K |I purchased the Lenovo K3 Note a two days before. But the phone is getting heat like anything suppose to use min of 10 mins. Please be aware. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 06 Aug 2015 |5| Good Product | Screen of Lenovo K3 Note is very-very fragile. I was carrying it in my trouser’s pocket and it had broken without any accident. I visited the authorized service center and they told me that it is not covered under guarantee and will cost 5800 Rs (58% of mobile’s cost). I purchased it from Flipkart flash sale on 15 July and received it on 22 July 2015. The screen got damaged in 20 days only, although this mobile was handled very carefully. 2 GB RAM sounds very attractive, but more than 1 GB is consumed by the OS. 16 GB Internal memory another attraction, but more than 4 GB is consumed by the OS itself. Back cover of this mobile is also of very-very inferior quality. I would recommend everybody to never purchase this substandard, third class mobile. It will never pay the worth of your money. Actual rating for this mobile is -5.8 (Minus Five Point Eight). - Govind 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 04 Aug 2015 |2| Do not go by Specs | The phone Gets heated up and also when we call for continuously like 10 min our ears get high radiation and we can feel after ending the call. Also the SAR value is 1.59 / 1.6 that is too high.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 02 Aug 2015 |3| After 3 weeks use -- reasonably satisfied with a few caveats. | I have been using this phone for the last three weeks. Overall, it's a nice phone to have. The pros are:

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 24 Jul 2015 |5| Perfect Choice | 1. Heating. If a call takes more than 10 minutes, you'll feel the heat. With the recent update, the heating is reduced but still it's there. Also when downloading via 3g, the phone heats up.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Aug 2015 |1| Very Bad |me...Yesterday your courier partner delivered my
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Aug 2015 |1| very bad |product at my residence....After opening the box, I was completely
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 08 Aug 2015 |1| Cheap quality, SAR dangerous to health, earphones doesn't work (initial review after using for less than a day) | just got this phone yesterday. there has been so much hype about it; like it happens with many things.. guess it is again a marketing gimmick. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 04 Aug 2015 |5| LENOVO FOR THOSE WHO DO.....PROVED |'JAYAKRISHNAN K J' review about this is spot on. But want to add another point on the earphones. This phone has a standard 3.5 mm jack and note that the earphones are not supplied with the package. So i used the earphones of my old phones samsung and karboon (both 3.5 mm) but those couldn't fit into Lenovo K3 500. They have not only not supplied the earphones but it seems they haven't tested this thing before rolling the product out. The earphones hangs into the slot with difficulty and even the slightest movement of the phone will disconnect them. It is so bad that while sitting on without moving at the same place if I just plug the earphones and then try to move the phone by even an inch it just disconnects.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 31 Jul 2015 |3| Nice phablet, but have some serious issues. |and remember no FM can operate without the speakers (it acts as an antenna). 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 24 Jul 2015 |1| Worst music Dobly sound and camera clarity | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 22 Jul 2015 |2| HEATING ISSUES & BAD CAMERA |Besides all the SAR thing that is dangerous to health (as mentioned by 'JAYAKRISHNAN K J' in his review) the 2900 mah battery also seems to be weak. i have just being using this phone for about 90 minutes for intermittent listening to music, browsing, and bluethooth transfer with data connection on and the battery is already at 88 % from a full charge of 100%. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Jul 2015 |2| Earphone |more reviews on it after i use this product for few more days. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Jul 2015 |1| SAR is very high for the device and I have started feeling the heat. cant use for phone calls |but for now i wonder how gsmarena, smartprix, ndtv, indiatimes and all those review websites miss these things. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Jul 2015 |2| calls getting dropped frquently |Better to buy some other piece.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Jul 2015 |5| All Good Comes in Small Price | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 11 Jul 2015 |4| Beast!!! | This phone is awesome. If a person wants good entry level smartphone(but it doesnt look entry level hehehe) . this is it ! no need to search any further . I have been using smartphone for last 6 yr. all i can say, you need a good brand phone moreover you need a brand whose service centers are easily available. N i can bet you wont have problems with lenovo. the specs this beast provides, what else do u want.(For me software n hardware must combine in good way) it doesnt have gorilla glasses still you would have put a screengd anyways even if you had gorilla glass.(GORILLA GLASSES is not a deal breaker) Camera quality is good ( its on cooler side ) n the touch is very responsive . But i faced a problem in removing the battery ( I had to use a knife for it o.O) lenovo please dont smack my warranty ! . This might be a problem in my phone . For this reason i m giving it 4 star. Or else undoubtedly i would have given it 5 Star !
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |5| Its a No Brainer - Just Grab this great phone at this awesome price.. | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |4| Awesome device to hold |Peace ! Flipkart your delivery is awesome ! well done :) 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |5| Amazing Phone in this Range | The features are already known. I can just confirm that they are all very much there and I am loving this phone. At this price, I do not think there is a better piece in the market as of now. Don't think much.. Just try to grab this in the next sale!

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |1| Fake reviews: |Pros - 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 01 Oct 2015 |1| don't buy this phone |1) As they said it's 5.5 inches screen, but not others
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Jul 2015 |1| Battery Pathetic Pathetic Pathetic Dont waste money on this bullshit model |2) Dolby digital - I agree the sound is good.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 13 Nov 2015 |4| Great | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Sep 2015 |1| Heating like iron box. |Cons - 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Sep 2015 |1| Over Heat |1) GUI of the android 5.0 sucks, it not even matches the 4.4.4 OS of the Honor 4x
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Sep 2015 |1| K3 Note is a real Killer |2) Camera both rear and front camera quality is like shit
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Sep 2015 |1| Lenova K3 note. |3) No head set with the package 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 01 Sep 2015 |1| LENOVO K3 NOTE IS REALLY BAD PHONE NOT WORTH FOR MONEY ATALL | I too have purchased the K3 NOTE and got the delivery on 10th july in the morning.I will give reviews after fifteen days.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 24 Aug 2015 |5| Review after using the phone over a month; All issues addressed. | I ordered this device on its first flash sale itself, so I am using this phone over a month now. This is what I have to say:
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Aug 2015 |1| heating problem | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Aug 2015 |5| Best Phone then any other. |1) The phone is slim, light weight and stylish. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Aug 2015 |2| Not so great product | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 08 Aug 2015 |1| Useless Device |2) The main attraction of the phone, the FHD display, is vibrant and beautiful as expected. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 06 Aug 2015 |1| REALLY DISAPPOINTING AND CHEAP QUALITY PHONE | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Jul 2015 |3| Nice phone in 9999 but few problems |3) The device is smooth and lag free, I haven't faced any software issues till now. Multi tasking is not a thing to worry about with my phone. It is working really well. The one thing which I should mention here is that the free RAM available most of the time: out of 2 GB only around 600 MB is shown free. I uninstalled most of the pre installed apps and I haven't installed any heavy apps in my phone. In fact I have installed only 11 extra apps in my device other than the inbuilt apps. Talking about the pre loaded apps, you can uninstall most of them on your choice which I thought is really nice. BUT, recently I found out that those apps were never completely gone from the device, when you switch to another user you will see all those apps again. So I guess this is what is meant by 'Bloatwares'. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2015 |4| Awsome | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Jul 2015 |5| A Piece Of ART!!!!!! |4) I like the Vibe UI. It is simple and user friendly. The one thing I didn't like was that the theme center had only a limited number of themes, but there is an option to export themes from the memory card. In the last software update they added 2 more themes and 4 more wall papers, which is nice. I hope there will be regular software updates like this in the future also. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |4| One of the best at this price range | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |5| Killer Smart Phablet under 10k | Bought this awesome phablet. Using it since last 8 days. Really feeling like using a 25 k phone. Those who are spreading fake reviews are totally mad & people's without brain. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |4| BEST PHONE BUT DOES NOT REACH TO MY EXPECTATION |I truly say go blindly for this awesome phablet.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 16 Jul 2016 |4| Good Buy |Light weight, sensitive touch, nice camera and decent battery backup is what is required from a good smartphone. But all the features at this price is a real steal.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 23 Jun 2016 |1| Please don't go for it. | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 May 2016 |4| Nice model |I would update the review again post using the phone for a while, but so far so good. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 May 2016 |1| Worst Phone Ever.. | Review after using k3 note for 38 days.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 May 2016 |5| Must Buy |I boughtt k3 note in 1st flash sale (8th july) and delivered on 11th july. My Antutu performance is 43653, which is very good.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 May 2016 |1| Nonsense piece |First thing is Software update - Please update it with 17 MB, don't go for 296 MB update otherwise you may face some Heating or wifi or Battery backup issue. I have the 17 mb update in my system and facing no problem at all many are reporting to have problem. So its better wait for few days. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 May 2016 |1| Lenovo K3 Note |PROS- 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 May 2016 |3| Good but not excellent. |Display - full hd crisp display, pixel control is awesome, Viewing angle very good. you are getting a dual core graphics processor which is powered by mali-T760MP2 i.e. the latest battery efficient, powerful graphics card ever even from adreno.. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 May 2016 |2| Bad cam & phone hangs too | Very bad cam compared to zenphone and other mobiles of this range and the phone hangs very often!!
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 May 2016 |1| Won't Recommend This Phone to Even my Enemy | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 13 May 2016 |1| after 6 months review of lenovo K3 |. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 13 May 2016 |1| bad touchscreen | The biggest issue with the Lenovo K3 Note is the touch screen issue. Your touch screen will stop working in some time. Mine started to stop working in 15 days after purchase which prompted me to ask for replacement from Flipkart. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 May 2016 |1| Worst product |Going through the Lenovo forum I found out that literally everyone is facing the issue. This is precisely why I won't recommend this phone to anyone. The Lenovo online support is pathetic. There is no official on the forum to look into your issues. People who took phones to service centers are complaining that they are taking 30 days to fix the phone. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Apr 2016 |1| worst phone ever ....... do not buy this phone.... |You can get much better phones for 10,000 with good service as well. Let me tell you guys one more thing. Lenovo provided a Marshmallow update for Lenovo K3 Note. This update crippled nearly all the phones. Lenovo Forum is full of people complaining about issues post the update. Well there is nobody to listen to them. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 13 Apr 2016 |5| I LOVE LENOVO |Don't believe a single thing that I have said. Go to the Lenovo Forum and check it out for yourself. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 13 Apr 2016 |5| I Love to shop here....... | Suddenly after 6 months, it has started giving major trouble with battery. Within 30 minutes of 100% charging, it comes down to 2%. Beware of the battery quality. Buy something like samsung or iphone, if you can afford it 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 02 Apr 2016 |4| Good phone but below expectation. | parts of the touchscreen stopped working within 8 months of purchase....

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 03 Feb 2016 |1| Too Many Issues with the product | Considering all the good feedback here, I purchased this mobile. But may be to my luck, mobile has too many issues, i guess there are some sort of manufacturing defect in the mobile i got. Every time i contact the customer service they suggest me to "Factory Reset", I have already done that 4 times.Am still waiting for a final solution... 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 02 Feb 2016 |1| Worst Product | The Mobile touch stops working within two months time only. No inbulit music player. Worst quality phone in this cost. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Jan 2016 |4| FHD Phone under 10K ! | Excellent phone at this price point. Actually the only Full HD phone under 10,000. This is my second K3 Note. Previously got one for my sister and now for my wife. Both are working fine till now! Definitely best phone if your budget is 10,000 or less. Recommended.ð??

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 08 Jan 2016 |1| Really horrible experience. | i am facing touchscreen problem from some days..while typing some keys are not touched and have to touch 3-4 times 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 08 Jan 2016 |4| REALITY SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED RATHER THAN READING A REVIEW | Signal / connectivity is very poor, signal drop down very often, camera quality is not good, speaker is very bad. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 08 Jan 2016 |2| Average Phonel | I have used it and performance is good only problem is service center I could not find. If lenovo could provide service through Lenovo PC Service dealer it would be better. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 08 Jan 2016 |2| OK Phone, awful after sales service! | I bought this phone in a flash sale on 31 July 2015. It was delivered promptly and in good condition. On installing the sim card and charging the battery, it performed flawlessly (for some time!)
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 08 Jan 2016 |1| Dont buy this phone |Appearance: The phone's appearance may not appeal to those who prepare a flamboyant style bu to those who prefer a functional product its minimalisitic design should be attractive enough.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 08 Jan 2016 |1| one of the worst phones i ever purchased |Performance: It was flawless for 3 months. The sound was the best I have heard in a mobile phone. The screen resolution was quite good though the build quality seemed a little flimsy.After 3 months it stopped accessing the internet. At first I thought it was a network fault. I was able to access the net via WiFi. But it was confirmed at an airtel office that the fault was in the phone.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 07 Jan 2016 |1| Defective product send |Service: There seems to be few authorised Lenovo service centres in Chennai. I took it to one of them, AP Technologies in Egmore. It was in a cubby hole in a basement with no air conditioning. I had to wait there about 40 minutes among about 20 sweaty bodies to merely hand over the phone. I was told that somebody would phone me the next day with the diagnosis. As there was no phone call, I tried calling them more than 20 times without success. The next day was a repetition of the first. So I went back to the dreadful service centre. I found that nobody had even checked the phone 48 hours after handing it over! After another 40 minutes wait, I was told that the fault was a 'water leak' not covered by the warranty! The phone had been used carefully and well away from water. I took my phone and left. The service centre apparently 'services' also Motorola, Alcatel and Xiaomi phones as well as others. It should be more aptly named a 'Fleecing Centre'!

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 07 Jan 2016 |1| I am not satisfied with this mobile | lot of problems.i use just one month.hanging problem.low perfomance.hanging problem.average battery backup 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 07 Jan 2016 |1| wast mobile | i ordered 6 lenovo phones from flipkart but all of them were having the problem that they get hanged .the touch pad and camera were not working. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 07 Jan 2016 |1| network problem | They had send me a defective product.I have return the product for more than 3 times till now no action taken. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 07 Jan 2016 |1| A typical waste product | using it for 4 months now, and the performance keeps going down with each passing day.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 02 Jan 2016 |2| LENOVO K3 NOTE |2GB ram looks useless with a poor mediatek processor.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 01 Jan 2016 |2| Not a good one | On seeing the spec sheet,you will expect a power packed performance. But what you get from this phone is a lot of heat and lag. It heats up very quickly at the head and the touchscreen lags many a times. You will even doubt that if the specified specs are genuine. Two stars for fab display and Dolby atmos. If you are a gamer or a heavy user,stay away from this phone. Lenovo should release an update to solve these bugs to prevent us from throwing the phone away. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 31 Dec 2015 |2| ok | by look phone is really good even functions are very user friendly but sometimes i facing software problems and even bit slow sometimes. rest all is good. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 31 Dec 2015 |2| not good option for this range ... | dosent support earphone ... camera is not good ..wifi hangs very much ... below avg phone .. display is quiet good .. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 30 Dec 2015 |2| Battery backup is not up to mark | Last month I have purchased 2 Lenovo K3 note mobile phones from Flipkart . I had a lot of expectations on this model as it comes with excellent specs and also I heard that Lenovo phones are very successful in battery backup . But it was so disappointing to realize that this particular model is having a severe battery backup issue.. There is something wrong somewhere in its manufacturing I believe .. I have checked with my uncle to whom I presented the other mobile, He also said the same problem.. Is there any resolution for this backup issue from Lenovo .... Is the problem from the battery ? If so they should provide an alternative battery for this model at the earliest... 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 30 Dec 2015 |3| working fine but heating complaint | good camera

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Dec 2015 |1| Waste of money | This is a really bad phone from Lenovo. The back cover is made of rubber. If you drop it, it is gone. The touch has stopped working in less than 2 months of usage. Now need to waste time to go the service centre and get it repaired under warranty. Lenovo is better off manufacturing laptops. Would not recommend to buy this phone.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Dec 2015 |1| Waste of money | I have bought this a month ago and after only 20 days of using this set display have gone blurred. On top of that it is heating up whenever u try to restart it. Atleast you should have a disclaimer of how bullshit this set is!! Not blaming flipkart as 30 days is over and i couldnt replace it. Now i m making rounds in lenoivo service centre to get it fixed. Anyone interested in buying it think twice before you go ahead..

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Dec 2015 |1| Good in specs ,worth buying even if can use for one year |but some time when we use it long time for a day it got lag
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Dec 2015 |3| Good but slow due to RAM | Although RAM is 2GB, only 500MB is left for other applications, find sometimes it is slow. Camera boasts 13MP but quality is not so good. Rest all looks fine. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Dec 2015 |4| | I got the item before expected. Nice look, Speed Booting, Nice Camera .. Awesome music with Dolby® ATMOS™. Touch response is good, Vibe UI is also remarkable. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Dec 2015 |1| Pathetic product and poor service | I had purchased the unit one month back and now i am facing problem with touch screen and key ,Sometimes need to press very hard to type a alphabet and sometimes none of the keys is working, I have contacted lenovo customer care and as per them i have visited nearest service centre,Once i reached there service centre i found there is long queue of people,who is having the same problem, Then i realised that it was my biggest mistake that i have bought Lenovo, After reaching to the counter,Service person told me that i need to drop the phone for min 9-10 days to maximum they don't know, Then i asked them to provide stand by so that i can do my work with that,which they denied,,, So thats the kind of service i receive,..... Hence buyer think 100 times while purchasing lenovo ...and also just search google you ll find there are N nos. of Shop across india ,who has stopped selling Lennovo with Board written at there shop as we are not selling Lennovo because of there poor service.... 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Dec 2015 |3| MIC problem | it was good for first month, but now mic is not working properly,,, i can hear everything over call but other person is not getting any sound or very low sound... can't even replace it... it is in warrnty period, have to go to care centre..

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Nov 2015 |4| Lenovo service center review |One of the worst purchase I have made so far. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Nov 2015 |1| Not Recommended |All third class cheap components installed, poor design (Technical design) .... It even does not have proper name; Mentioned as Lenovo K3 Note, but Device Information shows: Lenovo K50a40.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Nov 2015 |1| Please don't by this one | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Nov 2015 |1| Bad One |Does not updates to latest 5.1. As per service center, it has issues in Android 5.0, but does not have any lower version ... ha ha ha.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Nov 2015 |4| best phone at this price | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 08 Nov 2015 |1| Extremely Bad Phone |I'm not able to set a ringtone for rings & messages. It defaults to irritating tone "Curiosity" every now and then. Despite of change, even when it shows some other tone selected, still it plays "Curiosity". Screen takes time to adjust on Auto-brightness. Heating is a major issue; you can not touch to your ears; it heats up near speaker (front). Its been to service center as its touch stopped working. I guess its because of heat that desipates on the front surface; screen & touch.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 06 Nov 2015 |1| Third Class Phone Review After 3 Months | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 03 Nov 2015 |1| An Excellent Crap-My Honest Advice Dont Purchase |Company boasts true, that it gives high score in processing etc, but if you happen to load any heavy games, it becomes too hot, and slows down drastically.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 02 Nov 2015 |2| Bettery performance is not good | Battery performance is not good, Yes I purchased Lenovo k-3 note from flipkart on 26th September, 2015, other performance is satisfactory but it is bettery performance is not good. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 02 Nov 2015 |4| | The Flipkart service was good enough. I had no problem with that. Coming to the specs, all were excellent. But but but...When playing games(any) say suppose clash of clans.its a 2D graphic game yet the upper screen and the portion of the case where the front camera is located overheats. And the battery drains 5-10% after 10 mins of gameplay. And drains 1% every 2-3 min(normal usage). The other specifications are good. I think Lenovo should release 5.1 or above and fix these bugs,(battery and overheating) ? 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 01 Nov 2015 |2| Not upto the expectation | Mobile is ok but not upto the expectation, battery is draining very fastly, not even one day max 12 hours if we keep 3G and using for calls.Camera clarity is ok 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 01 Nov 2015 |5| First Review After Using K3 Note for 3 Days | First of all regarding shipping, it was excellent, reached before scheduled date of delivery (Staying in Capital). Packaging was safe to avoid any damage due to mishandling during shipping. The phone box was packaged inside a cushion plastic bag which was further in-boxed into hard brown box. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 01 Nov 2015 |1| Think twice before buying. | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 30 Oct 2015 |1| Ear phones (Headsets) not available in the pack |On opening the Cellphone box, the fresh items were obtained i.e. K3 Note, a Battery, a Charger, a USB cum Charging Cable, a Screen Protector and a Manual. All items were genuine product from lenovo and fresh brand new. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Oct 2015 |5| Perfect Delivery with good condition |Regarding Usage its good till now, Display is awesome, camera quality is good for Primary Camera, slim design, light weight, dual micro sim set, sound is good. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Oct 2015 |1| Heating Problem-- in Normal condition. very worst |Regarding biggest negative issue mentioned in other comments : I have not faced any issue of heating as of now. Slightly warmed near earpiece when using wifi thats also if u specifically try to feel it otherwise its not that much heated to be noticed. Used wifi for updating softwares which took around 1 hour and there was no overheating. Called few of my contacts and talked with them continuously for 15-20 minutes no heating observed. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Oct 2015 |5| Excellent performer at this price range |The only issue which i faced till now is fast battery drainage. From 100 % it moves to 70 % too fast (within 1 hour) than it stabilizes there (3-4 hours) and once its down to 35% then it will take just an hour of usage to be empty. (Usage involves surfing, wtsapp, facebook, video and pics browsing from gallery). 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 27 Oct 2015 |4| Best at its price. |Overall i am satisfied with the product within this price range, its providing more than enough from what we invested point of view. In the same range you will not get what it offers from good brands. You can get cellphones with same features in same range but brand will be third class. Lenovo is new for cellphones but its there in IT sector from years. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 27 Oct 2015 |5| Worse Buy | I have just 3 month old hand set. Initially it was fine but now since two weeks it has started giving network reception issue. Whereever there is weak signal it is unable to talk with this phone while other phones are working normal on the same location. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 26 Oct 2015 |1| Heating Issue | Hi All,

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Oct 2015 |1| Please dont buy this phone |About my Lenevo K3 Note, its just awesome mobile as far as speed, performance, display etc. Camera during dull light may be a little problem, but in this price range it is worth enough. Battery is very good, I have been using Data Connection/WiFi and Voice calls but it last long for more than 1.5 days. With 5.5 inch screen we should rate battery for 5.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Oct 2015 |4| battery charging |Overall Super Mobile. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Oct 2015 |1| Don't buy complete waste of money | My lenovo k3 note just arrived a couple of days ago. I have noticed it gets heated up near the upper part and esp the ear piece just after surfing the net for 10 min.Complete waste of money

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Sep 2015 |5| Lenovo K3 Note Review | My ever worst experience with Flipkart is this. I have purchased Lenovo K3 note with its promising and convincing specification @ Rs. 10K. When I actually received the product in hand and used for 3-4 days, I noticed that it has a major heating issue. Even if I talk on the phone for 2 to 5 mins, it heats badly and it is very difficult to place near to your face. When I charge the phone, even then it heats a lot. I am afraid of happening something bad with its extreme heating. Frankly speaking, I fear of its blast every minute 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Sep 2015 |5| it is wirst phone,having lot of hardware problems, frequenly hanging don't buy it | K3 note is killer phone compare to the other phone.Best phone that Range 9999 and super features.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Sep 2015 |3| ok! | the features are good. But there are software bugs. rarely headlight turns on in pocket. sometimes hangs . alarm doesn't ring in silent mode. Once I needed to remove battery and place it again, because it was not switching 'on' after charging. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Sep 2015 |1| This phone has genuine heating issue | opened the packet, power ON the phone, followed the setting (on screen) instructions.......1) language setting........2) date format setting..........3) set up the google account.........that's it and the phone temperature started rising. All this happened within 10 minutes.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 29 Aug 2015 |5| Great Product ! |1) Phone is getting hanged continuously during calls even.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 29 Aug 2015 |3| I don't say not to buy but think before buying |2) SIM slot is poor and unable to provide a sophisticated contact area for quality calls.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Aug 2015 |1| wifi connection problem | Its awesome. Unlike other comments about this product there is no heating problem in my set during call and for information, given SAR value is maximum when we are using all frequency at a time i.e. having call while wi-fi and bluetooth are in operational mode. I think there is nothing to worry about high SAR values and yet I have not found any problem so I am really happy with my set and also with flipkart service.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 27 Jul 2015 |4| Rich feel and Smart Buy | Lenevo Brand at this price is a value buy. Other similar specification variants also make up a good competition price wise and feature wise but confidence with Lenevo is something you wont get.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 27 Jul 2015 |4| nice mobile | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 26 Jul 2015 |4| awesome !!!!!! product |The hardware and the software bundle is premium feel. The Super Power saver and Battery saver both are pretty useful seeing a big screen size phone as display is what takes most of the battery.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 26 Jul 2015 |3| NO HEAD PHONES |Camera is also decent and takes clear picture and handles shakes and vibrations well. Front is a decent selfie one, not that great when zoomed but don't expect much from a selfie perspective.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 25 Jul 2015 |5| Utterly Buttery smooth |Only thing i think they have to work on is the footprint of the System(OS) image on RAM usage.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2015 |4| YOU CAN GO FOR IT! | It's been around two weeks that I have been using the Lenovo K3 Note, after I managed to bag it in the very first sale. Since then, the phone has received two updates, on e immediately and one a couple of days back.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2015 |2| Good Phone In This Price Range With Very Nice Camera Quality But SAR Value Is Bad | This Phone Is Batter Than Other Phone In This Price Range ,, 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2015 |5| Awesome phone |It Never Leg , Nice Camera Quality Gives HD Images , And Performance is little Slow Because Of Its Processor But Nice Phone , Battery Is Good Its Gives U 24 Hour To Used It If You Are Playing Hard Games Like Call OF Duty And All Its Gives You 5 Hour Its NIce By The Way .... But But But One Big Problem With That Is Its SAR Value Its To High Its 1.59 And The Limit Is Only 1.6 Its Bad For Health And Health Matters A Lot , Its Cause Headache And Irritation And Many Other Problems , And Its Hang Sometimes As Well And Its Drops Frame When Playing Games , If You Want That Phone On Your Own Risk Take Risk And Buy If You Wanna Go Safer Choose Others .. If You Wanna Buy Any Phone Because Of Camera Go With That Now Your Choice 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2015 |4| Nothing Special than A7000!!!! | This is an awesome phone for the price, the only thing it lacks is Gorilla Glass protection If they add it to this phone this will be the best phone under 10000 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2015 |3| Descent phone but over hyped description | I was using A7000 for last 2 months and gifted it to my friend to buy K3 note. Performance wise and look wise its not better than A7000 in any ways. May be the screen resolution is FHD with 401 PPI but you will not notice any difference from A7000, I felt A7000 is much better in screen resolution than K3 note! ABOVE ALL THE BATTERY BACK UP IN A7000 IS MUCH BETTER IN A7000 but K# is having a bit big battery (100 Mamp) than A7000!!! Yes 16 GB RAM is an added advantage but most of the application installs in internal storage and they cannot be moved to the SD card !! But A7000 supports movement to SD card for most of the applications (like FB, whatsapp, Axisbank, IRCTC etc). The Rear Cam is just little better than 8MP rear cam of A7000. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Jul 2015 |5| Great phone at Great price | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Jul 2015 |4| Awesome Phone killer performance!!!!! |But both A7000 and K3 Note is supper performer! 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Jul 2015 |5| Best mobile in its price range | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Jul 2015 |1| I not happy this mobile |My point is please do not go crazyyyyy for K3 Note....It is not OUT OF THE CROWD or any Mirror breaking meterial !!! Choice is yours. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Jul 2015 |4| Nice phone | In the BOX:
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Jul 2015 |4| Absolutely Amazing |Lenovo has made the packaging very simplistic with minimum accessories. Box consists of Handset, USB charger, USB cable and one scratch guard. No headphones with this phone out of the box. Warranty card, Phone feature pamphlet are neatly tucked below the phone holding packaging.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Jul 2015 |5| Great phone for the price | The hardware is good - good performance, battery life and speed. You can run many application without any lag or slow down. Feel wise almost every thing is average quality - build, display, camera, speakers, but quite acceptable. Based on the features that it offers for the price I would rate it at 5.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Jul 2015 |4| Radiation could be felt | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Jul 2015 |5| Planning to buy this phone ? Read my review first. |I had to replace the custom lenovo launcher with a original google now launcher from google.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Jul 2015 |5| good product @lowest price | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Jul 2015 |5| Exellent Working Device |If you are looking for a phone in this price range, this is the best option available right now. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Jul 2015 |4| A GREAT PHONE FOR ITS PRICE | I will write the Cons first and then Pros.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Jul 2015 |3| All looks good but bad camera | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |4| 5 Star under Rs. 9999/- |Cons:
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |2| Good on Paper.. Crashes Randomly |1. If you had used a phone with lesser SAR and if you dont know what is radition, this phone for sure will give you the feeling of what is radiation. I could feel the heat even for small duration calls(So only reducing the rating to 4stars). Not sure how it would be for people who speak for long durations. As I don't have the need of speaking for longer times on phone, this is OK for me. Otherwise you need to have a check !
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |5| Good value for money product by lenovo |2. 13MP camera is just OK. You need to have very steady hands to click good photos with less noise. Photos clicked in daylight are better than the ones clicked at low light.But I had clicked better pictures with the 8MP camera of my previous samsung(galaxy grand). Well I have not yet transfered the fotos to my system to see how good they look like.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |1| HEATING PROBLEM! Ear pains even for a minute long call | Updated after using for 3 months:
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |4| K3 Note...Value for Money....but with Front Camera Anomaly.. it clicks Mirror Images ;-( | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 17 Jul 2015 |5| loving it :) |Adding to the below CONS this phone continues to heat up while on voice call which is totally unacceptable and my ears start paining even during a minute long call..is it becoz of high SAR value..whatever it is , i think this is dangerous and I am reducing the stars to one or probably zero and dont recommend other to buy it.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 16 Jul 2015 |4| Its a deal for sure | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 16 Jul 2015 |4| Awsome product for an affordable price. |I have decided to exchange it for a new MOTO X which definitely offers much better features,build, great user experience and safety for a slightly higher cost !

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Jul 2015 |4| Very Good Phone |CONS:
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Jul 2015 |5| Lenovo K3 Note |Severe heating problem! 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Jul 2015 |4| A normal phone which is heavily hyped! |Had tough time to remove the battery the first time,it was just stuck there ! now could do it somewhat quickly
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 15 Jul 2015 |5| #KillerNote |Was worried about high SAR value but that is still within permissible limit however the way it heats up in few mins of usage really looks dangerous.If heating persists for few more days I will be returning it!

Please be aware of this lenovo K3 Note.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jan 2016 |1| Bad....................... | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 27 Dec 2015 |1| Biggest mistake of buying it |Thank you,
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 27 Dec 2015 |1| Worst OS from Lenovo |R.Prabakaran 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Dec 2015 |1| Worst service from Flipkart. | Very Bad Product Recommend not to buy , Touch screen was damaged replacement time 20 days ,service very bad treat customer with no respect 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Nov 2015 |1| Review of my bitter experiece | Its just a piece of crap. I am having hard time using it. Always giving me problems from the very first day. First of all, i got a box with opened seal and the free screenguard was in very bad shape. I tried returning it, but Flipkart's been making fool of people by telling them about their easy return policy. They never returned it.I got a call by their so called experts and then they closed the return request by themselves. Don't go after its features, its not worth buying. Just look for some other good phones. Seriously, no battery backup, no multitasking, use it for 10 minutes and it will start to slow down and eventually will stop working because of heating problem. and I don't play any games on the phone, just simple surfing and its battery goes from 100 to 15% in just an hour and when you charge it, it takes around 3 hours of continuous charging to get to 100%. By features, it seems like a complete package but not worth buying. There are too many good phones in this range, just look for them, but not this crap. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 27 Oct 2015 |5| Best item on best deal. | Worst Phone I've ever used, there is so much lag, even though the hardware is good. Unnecessary customization done by Lenovo on standard android, leading to a huge impact in performance. Should release it with standard android without this useless Vibe skin by Lenovo. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 26 Oct 2015 |1| This order made my life suffering | I have bought K3 Note and after some time I discovered that Micro SD card slot is not working in Note, Hence I raised replacement request and I don't know why Flipkart rejected request for no reason.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 13 Oct 2015 |1| waste of money | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 07 Oct 2015 |1| Pathetic reply by Flipkart about 30 day return Policy |So I called numerous time Flipkart and explained issue which is as simple as a chlild can understand and they agreed to go further (hold on not to replace but to go with issue verification with application)
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 16 Sep 2015 |1| Display Not Working | within one month the phone half screen display not working. no response to touch. and also i find difficult to find the proper service centre in chennai. i am very much disappointed with this phone. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Sep 2015 |1| Unncessary delay in delivery | Being a Flipkart first subscriber I feel cheated when even the prodcust which are flipkart exclusive are not available with "Next Day Delivery" option.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Sep 2015 |1| NEVER BUY LENOVO K3 Note |So why should I pay for Flipkart first subscription, a short while ago Flipkart was offering many products with "Next day Delivery" and now I hardly see any product with next day delivery.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 05 Sep 2015 |5| Lenovo K3 Note |It is shameful, how flipkart, when at the peak of e-Tailing business, starting to dissatisfy the customers.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 01 Sep 2015 |1| Not upto the mark |I was not even given the standard delivery on time.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 31 Aug 2015 |1| Worstt Service by Flipkart and even worse return policy......Cheat!! |The promised the Item will be delivered to me by 16 Aug 2015 but after several calls to customer care I could get the product on 21st Aug 2015.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 31 Aug 2015 |1| WORST DELIVERY |Dear Flipkart please do not think that you are only online retailing business in India, there are others also, so please improve your customer service specially the delivery system and atleast the flipkart exclusive products must be available with "Next day delivery" option. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 25 Aug 2015 |1| good product but pethetic service and customer service | Purchased on 16th July was working fine until today morning suddenly touch stopped working and can't do anything on mobile.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Aug 2015 |1| worst phone |Also did a factory reset using recovery mode along with hard reset but still touch non functional. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Aug 2015 |1| Don't Buy this.. You're westing ur 10k and giving a chance to Flipkart to Insult you to the core. | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Aug 2015 |1| ORDER CANCELED | Hi,
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Aug 2015 |1| High Heating issue | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Aug 2015 |1| ordered the product on 5th August with fu |This is to state that my Order ID OD303605571606330200 has been canceled by Flipkart without informing or taking any approval whatsoever from me. Till yesterday, when I was checking the product status on my App, it was showing that "Product Delivery Delayed due to Sim Card" or something like that. On today morning, when I just check the status of my order it was showing as "CANCELED." I was wondering what happened and I called customer care. And I have been told that there was no one at home or the call from field executive was not picked up. I EXPLAINED TO "Ms. Madhuri" and then her Floor Supervisor "Ms. Vaishali" that I never received the call first of all.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Aug 2015 |2| Bad Rear camera quality &heating & wifi detecting problem | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 07 Aug 2015 |2| TrueTesting by me and conclusion are : |Above all, the first phone delivered at same address and for second one, no one even bothered to call, nor did I receive any messages.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 04 Aug 2015 |1| Third class phone ever i was use | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 22 Jul 2015 |5| Just Amaizing |Secondly, this is a rented house with two built floors and my landlord lives there on first and ground. And if you can check address there is no mention of floor, too. And there is not a single day when no one was there at that place. Plus, how can it be possible that One Phone has been delivered at the same address a few days back and this phone cannot.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2015 |1| Bad Mobile | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 20 Jul 2015 |1| Faulty Product - They don't replace - Stay away |Now, FLIPKART trusts more on its FIELD EXECUTIVES AND THEIR FALSE STORIES RATHER THAN CUSTOMERS. I HAVE NEVER GOT ANY E-MAIL OR MESSAGE FROM FLIPKART OR THE COURIER COMPANY. NEITHER YOUR APP WAS SHOWING THE PRODUCT WAS OUT FOR DELIVERY ANYTIME. IT WAS STATING THAT EXPECTED DELIVERY BY AUGUST 18, 2015 AND I CHECKED TODAY ONLY.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Jul 2015 |1| Good Product Sold by Very Bad Seller (Flopkart) | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Jul 2015 |1| WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE BY FLIPKART AND BAD PHONE FROM LENOVO | I am writing this review because I have experienced the worst service and cheat from both lenovo and flipkart. I ordered Lenovo K3 note from flash sale by flipkart on 8th july 2015. The phone got delivered to me on 11th july 2015. After using my phone for only a day it started heating from back panel and also the front glass started heating even if I am playing any game or music for only 2 to 3 minutes. I did a return request to flipkart immediately upon knowing the heating issue. After a day I got a cal from flipkart and they tried to check my phone temperature by using their app called smartcheck app. The flipkart executive easily said that the phone is working fine and there is no heating issue. I tried to tell him that its not good and the phone is heating even I am playing small games, but the executive gave me a rude reply by saying that the issue is resolved and if you are not satisfied that you have to approach Lenovo service center. Why the hell I will go to Service center when flipkart assures me 30 day replacement guarantee. It is the worst service by flipkart and I am very unhappy with the phone heating issue. Please dont get cheated by flipkart return and replacement policies as this are all to suffer the customer. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Jul 2015 |1| Worst Service from Flipkart, very disappointed | I ordered and got new Lenovo K3 Note. Back panel is not fitting properly, so i called them for solution. Since its not fitted properly it making noise if u hold my phone.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Jul 2015 |1| Lenovo K3 Note - Flipkart Goof Up | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Jul 2015 |3| this phone is gud but flipkart is fraud |Solution they gave : Sir pls press the mobile sir, if its making noise why are you pressing your mobile. ( even i hold i am facing this problem, see how careless they care).
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 11 Jul 2015 |5| Missing Mobile | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 09 Jul 2015 |5| An Escalation to Flipkart - Shipment returned |They asked me to go to Lenovo store for this issue. Which is not near my living area. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |1| Wait time is over But unhappy with phone | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 18 Jul 2015 |2| ok ok phone...lots of cons |So better think before you buy any product in FLIPKART. 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 14 Jul 2015 |1| good cofiguration but not the best | Flipkart thoroughly goofed up with the delivery through their logistics parner and as a result my order got auto cancelled. So, even after being one of the many customers to book it in the first few seconds, I am unable to get Lenovo K3 note delivered to me.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 13 Jul 2015 |2| too hyped phone |Very bad indeed 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |3| Mind blowing display. Crappy camera | Got lucky with the first flipkart flash sale. The phone has many unnecessary apps preinstalled. I didnt like preinstalled app especially the flipkart app and ofcourse the true caller app. Many games are also preinstalled an i had to sit and spend time to uninsall these.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |3| Heating issue |The notification centre is good and usefull. Sound is great. Display is mindblowingly awesome.There is no words to explain the richness of the display. The camera is disappointing. Despite being 13mp, the quality is bad. The issue seems to be software only as the preview is comming well .As soon as you click the photos are blurred and dull . I am always against spending more than Rs20000 for stuff like phone. So for Rs10000 the Lenovo K3 Note is is worth the money 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 12 Jul 2015 |1| lenovo's worst phone | When connected to Wifi or long talking in phone getting heat near ear.Remaining every thing is super... 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |3| Not So Killer | when i got this phone i was very xited, but when i start the phone after 15 min. its just heat up like fire. then the battery just stuck in their that's why i can't insert my sim or any thing. that is the worst phone i ever see./....... 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 06 Aug 2015 |1| Heating issue | I do not need to reiterate that the major thing going for this phone are the Specs n features it boasts of at such an affordable price. But I have encountered a few things on using it that tell me that it isn't really as good as the specs and the flash sale marketing "gimmick" make it out to be.
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 30 Jul 2015 |2| its not a killer phone.... | 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 29 Jul 2015 |1| Worst Phone ever |Pros:

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 10 Jul 2015 |2| Not a Good Make and Poor Looks | The features of the product are good but make is not impressive. In box accessories headset is not provided, you have to buy it separately which makes you fool.

lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 02 Nov 2015 |2| review after 18 Days of Use |Need to know that, why heating problem? Is it a hardware issue? Should I request for replacement? 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 28 Oct 2015 |1| DONT USE LENOVO | A great phone for the price you pay. The only thing I wish they could have incorporated in this phone which has been left out is the presence of back-lit keys. The 3 keys provided aren't back-lit so you might struggle at times in complete darkness while operating the phone 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 27 Oct 2015 |1| Horrible Phone | I bought my Lenovo K3 Note a few months ago and its touch screen has already started malfunctioning. The audio jack doesn't work anymore and the phone slows and heats up regularly at which point all I am able to do is remove the battery and plug it back in. I am going to replace this phone the first chance I get. It is horrible and I would've been better off with a Asus or a Micromax (which lasted me 3 years without much issue.) 
lenovo-k3-note-black-16-gb| 19 Oct 2015 |1| don't buy this mobile |

Hangs a lot. | I bought this product recently after reading wonderful reviews, but I am disappointed to see only less than 500 mb RAM is free out of 2GB RAM. Where that 1.5 GB RAM gone? If OS takes that much RAM than this phone is not what we are looking for. It hangs like hell 2-3 times need to restart to make it work. Need to go to service center.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 13 May 2016 |5| Absolute Stunner and Impressive | Look : 100/100 - Very good looking phone. Gold color and the finishing is super cool
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 16 May 2016 |3| Good looking phone with some drawbacks |Size : 100/100 - 5.2 Inch is neither big nor small. I can still operate with one hand.. I was using S4 earlier, not so light weight like S4 but still good.
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 25 May 2016 |2| Phone is nice and good, speaker has issue |Battery : 100/100 - S4 power was discharging 1% per minute. When compared to S4, this is too impressive.3100 mAH is outstanding. I am very much impressed with battery. I charged to 100% in the morning at 8.30AM. 3G is continuously ON and i was using Whatsapp, Internet browsing, Now at 12:48 PM, the charge is at 85%.. I am pretty happy about that. I guess the juice will last for the whole day with internet ON.
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 21 May 2016 |2| Heats up when used for Apps using Data |Display : 90/100 - Not so bright and sharp as S series phones, but a real deal for the price. Impressed again. My only worry is about it is not having a Gorilla scratch proof glass. I may need to use tempered glass.
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 14 May 2016 |5| Very Nice Moibile In This Mid Range. |Touch : 95/100 - So smooth and I dont see any lags as of now.
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 13 Jun 2016 |1| Money waste time waste. |Camera : 90/100 - Photos are good and can capture fast, but again not as great as S series phones. but at this price I believe this phone outclasses all other competitors in camera department.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 02 Jun 2016 |1| Overheating. Don't buy. Bad service | I bought this product and realized in a day that it is over heating. Had raised a return with Flipkart. Flipkart service is so bad that they say to type *#*#4636#*#* to check temperature. The code does not work at all in any samsung mobiles. In addition, as the mobile has no temperature sensor it is totally bluff to verify temperature just by a code or some app.

Really very nice looking phone with good features at a very right price. Display is super cool. My husband is having moto x play and I also wanted to buy the same. But when I checked this phone specification , I wanted to go for this. Using moto since an year and Samsung since 4 days. I can easily say this is no less than moto x. Even 13 mp camera can easily compete with 21 mp. There are very minute features that gives user interface much better. No heating problem as other reviewers said. Super cool looks. Overall best buy in this price band. Go for it without thinking too much.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 12 Jun 2016 |5| Review after 1 week of usage | Review after 1 week of usage : device is working fine. No issues till now as it is big Samsung brand. Small apps multitasking is very easy. Ram is sufficient to handle normal functions. No heat even while charging. Looks are awesome. Display is superb as it is a SAMOLED display. Camera clarity is fine and as per my expectations. Connecting whole day with data connection and in office with wifi but I am easily getting 1.5 day battery. In between listening music around an hour as well. The negatives are USB cable length is too small, headset is basic one, no gorrila glass and taking almost 3-3.5 hours to get full charge as battery is 3100 mah. But above all mobile is fine as negatives are negligible and for display apply tempered glass and if you are music lover so buy another set of headset. But in that price range mobile is best one. 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 11 Jun 2016 |5| Honestly the best device under 15k | Beautiful impressive design easy to handle,Battery backup is awesome. overall below 15k this is the best ever from Samsung & thanks to Flipkart for priority delivery..

Delivery was absolute smooth and actually before time. I got it under exchange. I liked phone specifications. Only challenge i feel is borders of mobiles were already scratched. Felt really bad that it doesn't look like new phone. It looks like already used phone. Phone specifications are awesome. Pretty fast and decent for moderate use. I don't play games so I can't rate on that. I removed two stars because of phone body which was having scratehes, color was off.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 29 Jun 2016 |1| Phone locked | Bought this phone for 13.5k on 17th of June, phone was working fine I loved it but after a week problems started to kick in. Firstly screen freezes at times, recent apps panel is not working some times. Sound is too low even if I keep it in my upper pocket sometimes I can't hear the ring tone. There is network connectivity issue as well, I tried using my sim on my other cell(Samsung Galaxy e7) it worked fine but on this one it's not. I raised a return request on 29th at 11:34pm but flipkart rejected that refund request. Now when I checked in with them they suggested me to goto Samsung service center get a job report, click a snapshot of it then send it to flipkart. I'm disgusted by them now, they canceled my return request without even getting it checked as it crossed 10 day return policy now today i.e 30th june return option is not present in my app. So I'm stuck with this faulty mobile, knowing I can't do anything about it. FLIPKART IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PRODUCT, SOMETIMES IT'S YOUR SERVICE THAT FAILS US. IF YOUR BACKEND TEAM HAD NOT CAMCELLED MY REQUEST, THEN EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE. BUT YOU MANAGED TO SCREW IT FOR ME. THANK YOU, I'VE LEARNT A LESSON "IT'S BETTER TO BUY IN A STORE RATHER THAN FLIPKART"

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 17 Jun 2016 |5| GOOD LOOK AND AWESOME PHONE FROM SAMSUNG | 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 17 Jun 2016 |2| AVERAGE |#Flipkart im not happy with the product. kindly get it return. 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 17 Jun 2016 |5| Good Phone | The J5-6 is a good option provided one understands the limitations. It is futile to compare the phone with other options in the market namely the Moto G4, or even the Moto G3. Surely these options are better in terms of certain feature sets like processor and GPU. However there are few other options in the market with an AMOLED screen at this price point. The phone itself feels premium at this price, with a metal body and looks best in the gold colour option. The screen though is 720px looks sufficiently crisp, and images appear excellent in the saturated AMOLED colours. The let downs are a lack of ambient light sensor and magnetic sensor, which means that you will end up fiddling with the brightness constantly, and also maps will not auto-orient. After heavy 3G usage, the phone was warm, but not too uncomfortable especially given that the sides are metal. The battery is phenomenal, and with moderate usage has lasted me 2 days with multiple email accounts, and Skype going on. There is a bonus of 100GB One drive data storage that will activate if you install any of the microsoft software (Word, Excel, Powerpoint). The Samsung family of apps comes bundled with no way to remove them (expected of course) and they needlessly replicate the google apps. They are definitely polished applications, but it would be better to offer them as free add-ons, rather than mandatorily bundle them using up a good deal of the 16G. An extra SD card is almost mandatory, and there is a separate slot for it apart from the dual SIM slots. The screen seems to be prone to scratching, and is not gorilla glass and a screen guard is also mandatory. The camera does a fair job, and I won't say its better or worse than equally priced competition. One does not buy a phone to replace a DSLR. Selfies are good, which is the main purpose of a phone camera IMHO. Overall the phone is a good product, though at the same price one may be able to obtain other choices with better processor/OS combinations. But choices are what make life interesting, and one must make a conscious choice and be happy with the decision.

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 14 Jun 2016 |2| errors |but small heating while charging................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 14 Jun 2016 |1| Bad service from flipkart | technical errors like sometimes unable to share photos via whatsapp, some contacts cannot be marked as favourites, some apps stop abruptly, cannot differentiate between sim memory and phone contacts, unable to export contacts. heating problem and bad speaker. 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 13 Jun 2016 |4| Look wise :). Performance wise :( | Within 12 days from date of delivery, display of phone suddenly went off while surfing phone. Really bad quality. After this flipkart is least interested in taking this phone back. I haven't been contacted from flipkart any time but they r sending sms saying that they have contacted me. Really bad service from flipkart. If this phone is not taken back then i will file a suit against flipkart and samsung 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 12 Jun 2016 |4| worth the money | First about Flipkart. Delivered the pack one day before the mentioned date . What's the bad is the pack delivered by a nearby grocery shop men and not by e-kart person ( even though there is no problem in the pack )telling that he is the distributor of that area that was not professional . 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 10 Jun 2016 |5| Excellent phone @ this price. |About J5 -6 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 09 Jun 2016 |1| Bad phone and pathetic service |I brought this my mobile because of Samsung , though am well aware of the specification that this mobile far behind the specification compare to the Chinese rivals (including moto) 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 09 Jun 2016 |2| Heat Up very Fast |Pros: 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 09 Jun 2016 |1| phone produces heat |1. Super Amoled display , main pro
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 09 Jun 2016 |2| It's OK but not much.... ;( | I liked this product when I bought it. Camera is very good. Amoled screen make your eyes relief etc. But slowly, I found following minus points.
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 08 Jun 2016 |1| This mobile is worst as Flipcart support |1- Its ringtone is slow.
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 08 Jun 2016 |1| Don't like it |2- device getting heated as its side is metal.(maybe)

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |1| Worst, Pathetic Shopping Customer Care Service. |4- Main issue is- it shows "Sim card Removed" msg frequently and you have to restart it. There is no other option. Same sim works fine on another mobile. 
samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |1| BAD SERVICE BY FLIPKART | I have made a lifetime mistake by purchasing this mobile that too with this flipkart. When i requested for a return and refund since this mobile has a heating and hanging issue. They are canceling the return again and again. This customer care guys are completely insane, Their reply is making us mad. If they don't want to accept the return then why the hell they have given that 30 days return option?

samsung-galaxy-j5-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 01 Jun 2016 |5| Good Phone | The earphone quality is absolutely pathetic, not worth more than Rs 20!! The audio quality is absolutely unacceptable. It's as though Samsung wants to punish customers that opted to buy one of it's cheaper phones. Flipkart website also mentions that the phone has noise cancelling headphones,a claim that Samsung refutes. I feel Flipkart meant to say audio cancelling or music destroying headphones!

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 13 May 2016 |4| Samsung J7 - 2016 Why & Why not to buy ? |2. It has latest 6.0.1 Andoid OS and Exynos 7870 Octa Core Processor with 2 GB RAM and 16 GB ROM - What else you can expect within 16k ? The gaming performance is fantastic with no lags. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 13 May 2016 |4| Overall good |3. 13 MP f/1.9 Camera quality is just awesome. The front camera as well is capable of taking good selfies.

I charged my phone to 100 % and it took about 2 and half days to discharge with 6-8 hours of talk time, 4-5 hrs of music listening and connected to WiFi/MobiData Network continuously. Isn't it GREAT ? and it took 2 hours to charge the phone from 0 to 100%. I am very surprised with the battery performance. Nice job Samsung.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 12 Jun 2016 |1| Samsung Galaxy J7 - 6 (New 2016 Edition) | Dear People Please dont buy this phone on flipkart. this s a useless firm with no dedication of work. they are such big liars cant tell u. this phone doesnt work as it has speaker problem. They told me they will return bt their policies are so difficult thtat it will take whole month but you end up with dead mobile. these ppl are big big liars. the smart app which they gave me doesnt download even. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 20 May 2016 |2| Good Phone but not happy with Flipkart |PLEASE PPL DONT TAKE THIS PHONE FROM HERE U PPL WILL SUFFER A LOT> THEY DONT REFUND THE MONEY 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 19 May 2016 |1| THE WORST AND WORST SERVICE by flipkart | Phone is good but I believe it's overpriced for the hardware what you get. Screen could have been FHD at the minimum and speaker volume is not great, have challenges to hear ring tone while on the road or outdoors. Battery backup is great. Lack of sensors is a big con and Samsung is just taking us for granted.
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 11 May 2016 |5| Really a beast in mid range phones | 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 17 May 2016 |3| Decent |Now the reason for 2 stars, my phone has a problem with signal reception and I always see either 1bar or no signal with sim 2 slot (It's not an issue with sim, tested with sim 1 slot and other phones) . I have raised a replacement request on day one when I observed the issue. Flipkart executive asked to me to install the diagnostic app and got the logs and said that I'll get a call from executive to who will physically inspect the device and make a call on replacement in 72 hours. Now it's more than 72 hrs., nothing has happened. I'm sure they will reject replacement request in a day quoting obvious reasons. This was the case with my Moto phone last year.
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 21 Jul 2016 |5| J7'6-Again Samsung Wins! |I believe integrity and trust are the foremost for any ecommerce vendor in market place and Flipkart is moving away from it. So guys please think twice before you pay significant money to a online vendor, also check and double check the replacement and returns policy. For now at least I'm not happy with the Faking Flipkart Customer service :( :(

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 21 May 2016 |3| Ok type phone | Nice phone but still overpriced it should be below 10000.00 inr 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 19 May 2016 |5| Great Budget Phone from Big Brand | I bought this phone (Gold colour) on 10.05.2016 midnight when the sale opened. Received in 2 days. As a budget phone from Samsung it is definitely a worthy buy. It has a bright HD display though FHD should have been the case, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM. Exynos 7870 is a powerful octacore processor built on latest 14nm technology which makes it highly power efficient as well as performance driven. This is a major secret of long lasting battery (coupled with 720p screen). OS is bloat free which a welcome change after many years. I am liking the new TouchWiz (same style as latest S7 edge). No heating problem and you can easily play hardcore graphic intensive games easily. Metal frame is very good but battery cover is flimsy. Samsung in 2016 should have put atleast Gorilla Glass 3 on the display (you need to invest on good quality Tempered glass screen). Though there is no secondary noise cancellation mic (!!!) but call quality is good. Speaker sounds very low, major disappointment though sound quality is very good if you use a good quality headphone. Recommended BUY. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 19 May 2016 |5| Incredible phone and service of flipkart | Cheers to flipkart for there incredible service delivered in 20 hours and the phone is superb as expected i was confused between redmi note 3 & lenovo k4 note but thanks to that creapy flash sale that turn my mood to this trusted brand.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 23 Jul 2016 |4| Nice Looking and Long Battery Phone | Purchased this product on 19/07/2016, the moment it became available. Started using it. Build seems to be superb, even better than before. Looks have drastically improved.I got more than a day of battery backup on the first day of use 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 23 Jul 2016 |5| J7-6, not a Fanboy review. | J7-6 is a beautiful cell phone could make a illusion of I phone 6s from far as per design considered. But its not exactly same like I phone, there is Samsung proprietary home bottom and camera, flash light design. Old J7 clicks more batter picture than new though the camera hardware is same. Camera application in marshmallow need more optimization. Nothing valuable upgrade as per me except the metal frame design with more slim profile. Phone looks far batter and premium than J7 2015. Rest of all upgrade not useful for a mediocre user. No practical use as of now for NFC in India as no NFC payment available as of date. Most people do not use a NFC enabled speaker system too. Also I have noticed Marshmallow lags a lot in this phone than Lollypop in 2015 model though this phone has a newer version CPU and more RAM, don't know why. But those people who used the old model like me can feel the difference very often. There is lack of sensors like Gyro so you could not use VR and google cardboard not supported. Might be software not optimize properly and Samsung lunched it too quickly before get go ahead from development team :) I am not happy with the performance but like a lot the new design. Battery was always better in J7 one of the reason why I always used to choose Samsung. Screen is same as previous model no change. Hope Samsung will release new update soon to fix the bugs in new OS. J7 is best buy no doubt for the price of 15k to 16k. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 23 Jul 2016 |5| Best phone after one month of use and review. | Thank you every one to write reviews referring to this I got the phone..... it just superb.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 20 Jul 2016 |5| Nice product | I am pretty much whimsical when it comes to samsung every time because of the obvious reasons. But this one i tell you flushes away those ill experiences down the gutter and with that range and the features + the built quality; i say it's a good buy. Well no stuff ever produced is perfect and those complaining about lack of features in this , i guess, expect samsung to close down as more inputs would cease the sale of other flagship models. ? (p.s. not a samsung fan as mentioned earlier, just an honest user review).

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |3| Beast of a phone with Sound of an Ant. | Samsung Galaxy J7 New Model 2016 is a Beast when it concerns Raw Power. The Battery Back up is Simply amazing, the pack had enough Juice to last me about 2 days on moderate usage. The performance of the set is Lethal. This phone Never Lagged or Hung and does not Heat only gets a little warm after playing for 30 minutes of Graphic Intensive Games like Asphalt 8 and Nova 3. SMSUNG's J7 2016 SMASHES All competition hands down. The Only let down is its Speaker Volume which is very Low while watching Video's on You Tube or for that matter listening to a track. The Ringtone is Barely Audible. The other CON of J7 is its Camera module whose performance at this price point of 16000 is simply unacceptable, when Its Chinese Counterparts like Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo come up with much better camera modules and at a much lower Price. Low Light Photography is Impossible, the camera module produces a lot of noise and even daylight images are not very Sharp. The 2015 J7 had a much better Camera and Screen RESOLUTION. The Screen Resolution inspite of it being a Super Amoled Screen does Live up to the mark set by its predecessor's, other than that J7 2016's performance is Superlative if not Exemplary. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |4| Item is good and delivered in given time | Item is good and delivered in given time. It is same as product purchaised in shop. we can sit at home and order 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |3| Not worthy | I took this phone. Camera quality is not at all up to the mark. It's not worth of 16000/-. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 07 Jun 2016 |5| Best Mobile | Best mobile I have ever used. Camera quality good, charging is so fast, OTG cable supported, slim set. Ear Phone may be better. Only Indian sim cards can be used.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 06 Jun 2016 |4| My opinion | Overall nice phone.but no notification, no auto brightness, Battery is good 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 06 Jun 2016 |5| Nice phone :) | I wanted a new phone and had several options starting from Lenovo zuk z1,xiaomi redmi note 3,Yunicorn,upcoming Zenfone 3 and the Samsung as well.I am a not a fan of samsung phones because of their silly design and laggy touchwiz UI,still after reading reviews and spending lot of time on youtube i grew very fond of this device.Coming to the specs it doesnt have an auto brightness sensor or full metal body or gorilla glass or fingerprint sensor like its competitors.Still the device is solidly built and the gold version looks great.Super amoled display and the exynos with no heating and low power consumption even during prolonged use makes its a great device.And the battery is very good as well for a 3300 Mah and charging times are also good.Go for a good tempered glass and a case to enhance the device.In comparing with xiaomi the super amoled and camera are very nice.The performance will be higher in xiaomi but heating and reliability issues will be there will in xiaomi if you are thinking of buying one. 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 06 Jun 2016 |5| Best & Smart Phone | I was waiting for this phone for long time. As I expected it is the best phone with large screen and very slim. Has Dual sim and 16GB storage capacity.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 05 Jun 2016 |3| Only India SIM Allowed | I ordered the phone for using as my second phone which I plan to use during my travel outside India (which I need to do frequently). The flipkart portal does not display the fact that only Indian SIM will work. When I received the phone, I saw the sticker on the pack mentioning that only Indian SIM can be used. I called SAMSUNG and learnt that foreign SIM can be used but one has to use Indian SIM upon landing overseas and has to make a call (using Indian SIM - means roaming charges) for 5-6 mins. Upon learning this I decided to return the phone (The pack seal is unbroken), but flipkart won't take it back!!!! I am disappointed with flipkart!!!!!

In the era of heating boxes for smartphones, this phone doesn't heat up at all. It flashes through anything you give to it. All apps work smoothly. Speaker's volume is satisfactory. I didn't find it extremely low as many had said. Battery life is the USP of this phone. Whopping screen on time of 12 hours! Just buy this one! Bang for your bucks.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 30 May 2016 |4| Data storage insufficient | i am very happy to have such a beautiful smartphone with me . * at first i was very confused which phone to opt as there ware many choices as the price was a littel high for j7 , i was thinking to buy mi note 3 which was under 12000 range . * but i thought a lot for many days and finally i decided to buy samsung galaxy j 7 and thank god it was my best choice . first of all is the display which comes in 5.5 ich with a super amoled display . * watching videos , playing games , brousing ,facebook are the best the best part is the camara with front flash with high quality image so people looking for a premium device with a decent performance , with the best display must go for this , a littel dissapointing , and the sad point is the some features missing , like geyroscope sensor ,magenetic sensor , finger print scanner , 720 resolution , insted of 2 gb ram , 3 gb ram would have been better * but i had become fan of the super amoled display * great mobile with only some features missing that dont mind for me . buy the phone you will feel proud and each time when you look at your phone you will be very happy because of its best design , i chooce the golden frame which looks premium *Now taking about the gaming it works lag free the colour reproduction , graphics , frames are all best , it is good that the phone supports 10 multi-finger touch , which helps you while playing shooting games , * Touch response also very good , smooth like butter feel very happy to right more and more by using the great mobile of samsung * I want to say that at first i was not happy about low budget phones by samsung which had the hanging problems , but now because the samsung has developed a lot it had given the best mobile under the medium budget * i would saythat samsung has gone far a lot and lot in 2016 *

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 23 May 2016 |5| simply superb phone |Amazing looks. pictures are decent. camera is slight complicated. but pictures are great. People ask me why i purchased Samsung phone when i can have other phones at a cheaper price and with more better specs this days. But I invested few more bucks in this phone for satisfaction and secure feeling the brand gives me plus it has got all the specs a basic user needs. i use my phone full time and as a student. i m perfectly happy with this phone. 1 star less because of the RAM it could have been 3 or 2.5 least.

samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 23 May 2016 |5| 1.6ghz 14nm exynos and speed (go for it) | Using this mobile for 12 days and its working fine . This is a beast in this price . You may get a fhd metalic look 3gb ram and fingerprint in this 16k but you cant get SAMSUNG and you have to through your mobile(iron brick) in 2 years . Processor is 14nm which is the main thing and phone will never heated even in playing blackout 5, asphalt 8 nova games .Battery is huge (3000 amp removable )and will last about 20 hrs (randomly playing games music and watching films ) Display is very good and you cant feel you are not using fhd . RAM is enough . Front Camera is not too good but ok but rear camera is awesome .14 nm exynos 1.6ghz processor is main beauty of this mobile . 
samsung-galaxy-j7-6-new-2016-edition-black-16-gb| 23 May 2016 |5| Samsung galaxy j7 2016 |So if you want to buy a real smart phone in about 16k this is the best so blindly go for it . Though you can get samsung galaxy s5 in about 17k which is also great phone but 2 yrs old now :)
